### Areas of Emphasis

  A central focus for this module, apart from gaining a fudamental understanding of Ruby, was definitely enumerables.  They seemed to be the most convoluted concept for me in the beginning. So, in order to eradicate this fear of them, I simply made it a poit to utilize them for every project.  I also focused a lot on improving my workflow via key shortcuts, iterm, and atom.

## Solo Projects
--------------------------------------------
#### JungleBeats

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/karinamzalez/junglebeats)

Introduction to Linked Lists. Great first project, established a solid foundation for understanding how to make objects interact in Ruby. 

**Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Pretty solid overall. Keep an eye on the counter method; it was a bit hairy

##### 1. Functional Expectations: 4

##### 2. Test-Driven Development: 3

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

##### 5. Looping or Recursion: 3
-----------------------------------------------------------
#### Enigma 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/enigma)

Great practice for enumerables.  Designed with the WWII Enigma in mind.  Created an encryptor, takes in your message and key to encrypt message, a decryptor, decrypts said message given the key, and a crack method which is able to decrypt given message assuming that it ends in ..end.. . 

** Assessed By: Nate

Notes:

* Talked about some tricks and made a pull request with changes
* Really great test coverage
* Good use of enumerables
* Indentation and general cleanup was needed

##### 1. Overall Functionality: 4

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

##### 3. Test-Driven Development: 4 

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components: 4

### Being a Community Member

##### 1. From Nick Dorans:
    Karina is a really cool girl, I knew that before I even met her because she was heavily involved in the Turing Hip Hop channel on Slack. Once I did meet her, I realized she’s a very intelligent girl who’s very passionate about different things. Things like public health, the environment, global issues in general, and art - all of which are things that I am also passionate about. Although I haven’t paired with her directly on a project, I have given her some help with a project or two and I noticed that she’s very quick to pick up on new concepts. She’s a pretty good programmer and one hell of a pseudo coder! I gave her major props for being the only team that wanted to do Headcount for their final project - someone had to do it! I believe Karina will do very well in the Turing program, and go on to be a great web developer. She’s already added great value to the Turing community at large.
##### 4. From Jon Liss:
    Karina when I first paired with you, you told me that you started the project late and after working on it for a while you said you were going to work on it at home and left.  I totally thought you were just giving up on it, but not only did you finish it, you did really well!  And now every time I see you working on a project, you’ve got a clear understanding of how to go about solving the problems presented to you, and what needs to be done to get there.  And when you do call me over for help with the usual “Lisssssssssss!”, you ask difficult questions that show me that you really do understand all the concepts of the problem, but just need a little nudge in the right direction.  I think you're doing everything right and you’re gonna crush mods 2-4!
##### 2. From Aaron Greenspan: 
   I’ve paired a number of times with Karina on her past two projects.  She’s equal parts curious, excited, and (highly) capable.  She also brings a light-heartedness to her work which makes it a blast to code with her and easy to code well.  I have never once heard Karina ask for clarification on a concept, plan, or code implementation.  This is certainly a testament to her uncanny ability to grasp a thing quickly.  But, I also wonder if Karina is hesitant to ask a big question and admit that something just isn’t making sense.  If so, I hope Karina comes to believe as I do that those questions don’t at all make one appear any less competent, but instead achieve the opposite.  Such questions will both speed her own progress and, most importantly, allow her colleagues to more readily benefit from her unique thought process and viewpoint.
##### 3. From Sonia Gupta: 
    Karina has been a huge asset to 1603, and to Turing as a whole. Her boundless energy and optimism foster a supportive and enthusiastic environment. I have often seen her working late into the night while still maintaining a positive attitude when faced with obstacles. Her tenacity and kind nature have profoundly resonated with me, and I am inspired by her successes.

### Playing a Part

##### 1. From Marcella Wigg : 
    Karina inspired me with her resourcefulness and drive as a partner, and I feel fortunate to have worked with her. Early on in the first module, I hesitated in asking other students for help, but Karina not only showed me that asking higher-module students for help is acceptable, she introduced me to students I now feel using as references in the future! The long hours she puts in at Turing show both her drive to succeed in her coding and her strong involvement with the Turing community.
