### Work

This module consisted of two individual projects and two group projects.

#### (Project Name)

* [Flashcard Project](https://github.com/bfpepper/flashcard)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

(In this project, I wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.)

(code is well-written
tests are solid
some confusion with trying to explain certain methods or connection between pieces
all base functionality complete)

(3, 3.5, 3, 3, 3)
