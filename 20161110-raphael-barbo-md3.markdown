# Raphael Barbo - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During module 3, I had set myself with two main goals; The first was to give back to the community, participate in gear ups, and spend a good amount of hours pairing with module 1 (which I believe I have succeeded). The second goal was to put as much time as possible coding, creating, and learning. I made the decision to really make this my best module and come out of it as strong as possible to start applying for Junior Dev positions.

#### Feedback From Teammates:

### From Nate:
Happy to have finally had a chance to work with you on a group project. You are a fantastic developer and always keep things light while we are working. I think we were very productive as a pair and the bonus was I felt we were laughing and joking throughout the entire time which made it feel less like work. The only thing I would suggest is when people have ideas or suggestions in a full group setting to maybe take a little more time to digest what they say before offering an alternative. But you have very good ideas so I understand wanting to express them. Other than that I have no other suggestions and I would be excited to work with you again. Great job buddy.

### From David:
Rahpael, this project was stressful at times but your perseverance and dedication to staying late to finish your tasks was prevalent throughout the entire time. Specifically on the Twilio SMS authentication, you stayed late and dove deep into the documentation to figure it out after everyone else had left home. I can tell you have a strong desire to not only do a good job on your assigned area of the project, but to learn from others in how to make it the best it can be. You're not afraid to ask for help when you're stuck, which is very commendable when you're working on a team project. On an area of growth, I would recommend you to to look into Rubocop as a tool to look over your code every so often. I've personally learned a lot about proper conventions from it, things like string interpolation where it's not needed and assigning variables without using them. This is minor but improving this area will definitely improve your code. Your commitment to the project and your agreeable pairing style make you a strong team member and I am happy to have had the chance to work with you.

### From Brian
Working with Rapha on this project has been very enjoyable. He is very energetic when working and would get visibly excited when we solved problems. This energy was infectious and helped motivate me at times when I was feeling tired, especially when he and I tackled implementing jQuery datepicker to show a calendar of available dates for a listing. He is also a very determined and hard worker. Rapha regularly worked late or worked at home after the group disbanded for the night, experimenting and implementing better test coverage. He is a strong communicator and freely speaks his mind which is a great strength, but he could work on his delivery as sometimes he can come off too strongly or a little harsh. He commented on the preliminary CSS styling I had done for the site in a way that was not very constructive, but then he apologized and clarified his intent, which showed his maturity and grace, and was quite impressive to me. In fact, he and I worked on the final styling of the site and he was incredibly complimentary and encouraging. Overall I really enjoyed working with Rapha and look forward to pairing with him again.

### Gear Up & Reflection

__Election Day__ I appreciated talking about the duty of citizens to vote. Jorge did a great job facilitating the conversation. 

__Introversion__ Introversion Within cohort GearUp. It was nice to be able to bring our cohort's concern to the table and talk about subjects that otherwise would have been overlooked.

__Resilience__ I welcomed the conversation about resilience. Knowing how to persist through difficulty seems to be a big part of being successful as a developer.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### To David:
I believe David is a great developer with amazing technical skills, and often times it helped us make sure we were heading in the direction.
I really enjoyed working with him, and my only constructive feedback, although complicated to work on since it is sort of personality related, its to be more open to people's idea, and don't stress too much about things that will get sorted out throughout the project (one instance, the very first Tuesday when he was a bit assertive about things that didn't necessarily needed to be figured out).
Other than that, I would love to work with him again.

### To Brian:
Brian is very easy to work with, as far as technical skills it was really fun to work with Brian because I feel we are at the same level, and it allowed both of us to contribute towards the features we were working on.
My constructive feedback to Brian is just to keep listing to people's ideas, and different approach to problems. The beauty of being a developer is that the are 200 ways to solve the same problem.
I really enjoyed working with him, and I am looking forward to see what he accomplishes throughout his time at turing.

### To Nate:
For me is a pleasure and an honor to work with Nate. Seeing how much he has evolved throughout the past modules is just amazing. Nate is easy-going, super communicative, and I have nothing but positive things to say about him. My only feedback to Nate on the constructive side of things, open up more about your thoughts and ideas, you have so much to offer and sometimes i feel like you don't speak enough about your great ideas.
I am super proud of you, and stoked to have worked in our first project together.
