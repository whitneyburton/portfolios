# Mark Van Akkeren - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
I arrived here looking at gaining a skill to then leverage along with my other skills I've acquired in my various and multifaceted careers.  That someone with such a diverse career background with also a developer skill set would be a valuable asset in the work force.  I had attended the July Try Turing class which was the convincing factor for attending (and friends saying "you'd be good at this" <-- i feel like i'm doubting them now ;), but i was "scared" of javascript and signed up for a night class at Galvanize.  It helped with warming me up a bit to coding and getting more comfortable with JS. The thing I've been repeating since day one has been "just get the skillset, just get the skillset" <-- in "just keep swimming" Dory voice.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Enigma was my only group project and it really lit a fire under my ass and motivated me.  I suck at "getting stared" (see comment on blank screen syndrome at the top) but with a partner I can't afford to allow that to affect me.  Cody jumped on it and passed over an outline almost ASAP, that was the catalyst and boom we were off and running.  We put in some long hours but our collaboration and DTR-ing was SOLID.  It was very enjoyable to work with someone and while we fell just shy of doing a full complete of the project it was a huge leap in progress from the previous work that was very incomplete. It was also FUN.

#### Enigma

Notes:
had zero tests
had one method that did everything
talked about refactoring and running the file properly
they are going to write tests and try to make the file work correctly by monday

MVA Note: we built out some rudimentary tests by Monday.  Understanding of TDD has come a long way since then.  

Overall Functionality : 2

Fundamental Ruby & Style : 2

Test-Driven Development : 1

Breaking Logic into Components : 1

MVA Note: I find it funny that the scores are so poor here but my reflection on the effort and result is so positive.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Growth Mindset
Listening to Sonia talk was the most resonate for me.  Someone coming from an established background that wants to try something new.  Easy in concept but harder in practice to teach an old dog new tricks.  Over the course of the mod I have realized that while I have a feeling that I have not failed anything it is because when I realize i'm not good at something I bow out rather quickly so as to never face real struggle.  With my committment to this school i'm facing failure and true perseverance for the first time in a long time.  Casey put it well in one group meeting that there are two aspects to this, grit is the act of pushing forward whereas growth is the acceptance of the struggle that is the process.  Slowly am i accepting this erosion of my ego, but it's a rough ride.

#### Cohort Norms
Intro vs Extro vs Ambivert - This was helpful, i've alwasy struggled when these talks come up because I can so violently oscillate between one or the other and in short spans of time too.  It was enjoyable to sit with a group that felt similar.  At times we are one, at times we are another.  Using the strneghts of both sides to advance certain areas of our work.  Also learning how threatening one way can be to the other, but then leveraging our understaning of both to further the efforts of a group task.  Growth: when feeling growth = extrover, when feeling fixed = introvert.

### Personal Stories & Connection
Ilana, Ken, Charlotte - While there was little that Ken or I found in direct common with the others that does not mean that we can't understand and work with the points of view expressed by others.  The conclusion was while there is great empathy, it is ACTING on that empathy that will advance things.  This has inspried me to lay the ground work for civic involvement in causes I support once I have more time to deveote to them.  

### Grit Mindset
It would seem i have very little lack of grit.  I _HATE_ being committed to something and not understanding it.  That drives me further in my effort to conquer the subject matter.  Grit seems to be the "physical" connotation of effort whereas growth is the "emotional" connotation of acceptance of the struggle.  I have great difficulty in accepting strugggle, it's not something i've ever really encounterd and its struggle is weighing down my effort to push forward.  I'm starting to "not care" about my emotional state and cast off my cares of "how i feel" in hopes of allowing me to push forward my objective learning.  "getting clinical" so to speak.  

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Personal Branding One

* https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md
* https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-van-akkeren
* https://resume.creddle.io/resume/2f01ty50fdc

While I understand the importance of this I had this work drilled into me during university and have almost 15 years experience of working with resumes and public representation of my person so feel very comfortable in this space.

### Learning to Pair

Driver - navigator nice in person making sure that who knows more is navigator and hopefully imparting that knowledge to the driver --- Ping pong helpful, I believe, for more evenly matched skill sets --- Screenhero really good for me cuz i'm super detailed oriented in describing where stuff is and describing what exactly is going on

### Feedback

This was good, helping me to learn HOW to frame the constructive portion of the feedback.  I've got a lot of intuition in this area with having coached people for 10+ years and figuring out how best to approach each person and make them feel very important while still providing something that improves them and drives them forward.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

1 - for Cody
You dove right into this so fast.  Right after the initial DTR you had code blocks/files set up and ideas down on paper.  Going forward I’d think more DTRs that aren’t centered around simply work styles and life styles, but also the project itself would really help us with setting deliverable check points and advancing the whole of the project.  Specifics… this is hard… at this point it would seem the material we are facing is far more the inhibitor to our progress than any way that you or I work.  It’s tough to make specific recommendations to your work style when all the barriers that might force them are because of our grasp of the content (this comment applies to me too).  If anything be open about the content you/we don’t know.  Again that circles back to just knowing the material in the first place.  Relative to what I heard from other groups, on the personal level, we were amiable to each other, both had buy in on the effort and did our best to get the core of the project finished.

2 - for Dan
Dan was a rock for me. We'd gone thru Try Turing together and so had a connection early on.  He's been incredibly giving and volunteered both his time to help me understand the material in class as well as allowed me to vent my frustrations. His patience in times of immense struggle and the guidance that he was able to impart left me better able to tackle the work.  He's well poised to further his development going into Mod 2.  I'm super stoked for him and look to him (and others) as examples of perseverance in the face of repeated hardships that can eventually bring forth great success.  


3 - for Amara
This is easy, Amara is the reason I was able to keep my emotional head (barely) above the water in the first 4 weeks.  She made sure to check on me and take stock of my health. The things I was doing for others Amara was doing for me.  Taking care of the human element in this mix of chaos that I was attempting to adapt to.  Beyond the emotional component she guided me thru the maze of syllabus material helping me see/find things that I had no idea about.  Amara is the embodiment of compassion :)


### Being a Community Member

1 - from Cody
Mark, you epitomize hard work. One of my biggest concerns in collaborating with others is a lack of drive and the tendency to spit the bit when the going gets tough, but it was never an issue during our project. I couldn't match your tenacity but I aspired to emulate it by showing up early and staying late. You're an excellent problem solver -- I felt like a lot of the time you were doing all the work because you'd just start putting things together whenever we got stuck. You sped through setbacks with ease and were quick to present ideas for solutions to our problems. Your background in working with athletes proved beneficial as you kept a positive attitude and knew the right things to say at the right time like giving praise or words of encouragement when things got tough. With my lack of experience in collaborating with others I felt like I held you back at times and if you were given another partner capable of better collaboration I don't think you'd have trouble completing the project to spec. To further your growth I think you can work to get comfortable with Github so you and your collaborators can stay on the same page throughout a project and try to interpret the project spec literally so as to not miss any requisite details.

2 - from Dan
Mark was awesome to work with in this Mod. His ability to think about things on a higher level really helped elevate my understanding of things we talked about. He is contantly here every day pushing to be better. Sometimes he is a little to hard on himself becasue I feel he knows way more than he gives himself credit for. Im priveledged to call him my friend I i look forward to continually working with him in the future.

3 - from Charlotte
When I was feeling really defeated about Battleship you sat with me and Max and helped us put our dissapointment in perspective. It was so incredibly helpful for me to hear that, from an outsider's perspective, it seemed like I was doing well. The encouragement was invaluable, and helped me adjust my attitude. I felt so much better after that conversation. I know that you struggled a lot this mod and I think that your attitude will help you through the rest of your time here. Thanks for the support.

### Playing a Part

offered myself as an open and listening "friend" to those that want to talk thru things - i'm no psychologist but being a coach has trained me to be pretty close to one.  We talk thru things and i dont give answeres but I ask questions that help them solve what emotional elements they are stuck on.
observing different backgrounds and having that inspire me to push harder on social change
