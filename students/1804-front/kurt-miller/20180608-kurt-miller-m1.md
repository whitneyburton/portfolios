# Kurt Miller - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to learn as much about Vanilla JavaScript and the foundation of front-end engineering as possible, while starting to build lasting and beneficial relationships with Turing Staff and students. It was one of the most challening 6 weeks I've ever experienced, but was definitely worth it and I can say that I am ready for the next challenge.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects were Number Guesser and three Static Composition Challenges.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/Number-Guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Description:

For this project, I built an application that generates a random number and where the user guesses a number of their choosing that starts between 1 and 100. The user can also set their own defined range using the min and max inputs in order to guess a number between those two inputs as well. The application also gives the user notice whether or not their guess is too low, too high, or is correct.

#### Static Comp Challenges

Description:
I received three individual static composition prompts and entirely recreated each one with a responsive design, while respecting the integrity of the original design. The creative license for each static composition included: copy, images, icons and color palette.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

My Paired Projects during this module were: LinkedList, IdeaBox, and 2DoBox.

#### LinkedList

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Description:
For this project, we recreated an application that adds a bookmark onto the existing page once a user inputs a website title and url. Each bookmark has a remove button and a "mark as read" button to easily keep track of their bookmarks, as well as a counter of how many they've read and how many bookmarks are unread.

Feedback to me:
Thank you for jumping in and meeting me where I was at on the project. It being the first paired project, delegation definitely didn't come easy. But you were great about communicating with me and I always felt like I could reach out to you at any time. Github was a little confusing for both of us, but it looks like it's going to be more and more important. Hopefully this project made it seem less daunting, but I would highly recommend referencing the Git Workflow under the lesson plans. It has helped me immensely.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michaelyons/idea-box) - Michael added me as a contributor for this project.
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Description:
For this project, we recreated an application that displays and stores ideas utilizing localStorage. With this application, the user is able to enter a title of an idea and a description of that idea and the displayed idea title and description persists upon reloading the page. The user is also able to remove the idea from the page and localStorage by clicking the delete button as well as change the "quality" of each idea with the upvote and downvote buttons.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kmiller9393/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Description:
For this project, we refactored a previous student's IdeaBox project and added functionality to it utilizing jQuery. Our refactored version allowed the user to edit displayed content (title and body content) as well as delete content.

## D: Professional Skills


### Gear Up

#### Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

This session was especially helpful and important given how stressful of an environment Turing can be. It was very beneficial to learn about the various types of stress, how to measure stress, and ultimately how to regulate and manange these types of stress. This session definitely helped emphasize to me that being mindful of one's stress is extremely important to ensure the best personal health and personal success.

#### Code Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md

This session was extremely important in pointing out how there is such a large gender gap within the tech industry today. This session also did a great job of pointing out how important a diverse team of employees is to make sure all groups of people who use their products are benefited as a result. I will definitely keep all of this in mind during my coding career moving forward.

#### AI Caramba

This session led by Module 4 students was extremely interesting and I was happy I had the opportunity to attend it. We talked about the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in today's society and discussed whether or not the advancement of AI will ultimately be a benefit to society or a problem. It was great to learn more about how AI could potentially benefit daily life, but also good to see how it could hinder it as well.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

During my time so far at Turing, I have made sure to participate regularly in the classroom and reach out to people, regardless of Mod, outside of the classroom. I have made sure to pair with at least 2 or 3 people on a weekly basis and my learning has definitely benefitted because of it. In the future, I am going to make sure I am a open resource for students in lower Mods and continue to support the Turing community.
