# (Nick Dambrosio) - (M2, Part 2) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Hello friends.

Around week 4 of last mod I faced an unfortunate realization that I wasn't quite where I wanted to be as a student / developer. I excelled in many areas, and all my projects had been mostly on point-- but my problem solving skills wasn't as fleshed out as I wanted it to be, and I wasn't able to well-enough articulate my process. I knew that I'd have to make a choice to repeat the mod soon, and that decision would likely shape how I approached those remaining two weeks.

I decided to spend the remainder of the mod focusing on React and getting as much experience with it as possible and redo the mod. It wasn't necessarily a _fun_ moment (as failing to succeed at anything isn't _fun_), but it was one that I knew would only benefit me in the end.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### (nick dambrosio - Front-End Dev Portfolio)

An HTML/SCSS portfolio I built used to demonstrate some unique effects you could achieve with just HTML and CSS with dynamic layouts without the use of JS. I took this project with me to the Turing Top Talks at the beginning of the mod, and it was incredibly well received.

I hate it now.

Will be redoing it over react over the next few days.

#### (Stomp Snowboards)

- [https://github.com/30ozSteak/Snow-Tell](https://30ozsteak.github.io/Snow-Tell/)

# Description

A fun experiment into creative layouts and css tricks. Learned a lot from building this, can't wait to visit it again and make it slightly more generic, so its content can be modified easier.

#### (1804 Gametime Browser)

- [https://github.com/30ozSteak/1804Game-browser](https://30ozsteak.github.io/1804Game-browser//)

# Description

A directory website that has links to 1804's gametime projects, Javascript games that use HTML5 canvas and can be played in browser.

### Projects

#### (Gametime - Snake)

- [https://github.com/30ozSteak/CB-ND-Gametime-Snake](https://30ozsteak.github.io/CB-ND-Gametime-Snake/)
- [Learn about Object Oriented Programming while you build a game in HTML Canvas]()

# Description

Coming into mod2 I was most excited for Gametime. Tory Dannenberg had shown off a really fun adaptation of snake during his Mod2 Gametime project, and it started giving me ideas for what I wanted to accomplish with mine. I was also paired with Chris Boylen, who was repeating mod2, so a lot of the initial hurdles that I likely would have faced with canvas we cleared with moderate ease, as he already knew what to look out for. Chris was an incredible partner, and the late night sessions we had with him, Jesse, Megan, and myself were super helpful.

Back on topic: Tory's gametime game had a fun spin on it's name with 'Severnus Snake'. I took this and ran with it and all of a sudden we were giving the game an "Escape From New York" aesthetic, and the game starred Snake Plissken, an ex-special forces soldier stuck on Manhattan Island Prison.

# Evaluation Comments (P. Lovett)

- Love the UI AND those angled divs.
- Appreciate that the game is the centerpeice of the the app and that additional info can be found further down.

#### (Weatherly)

- [https://github.com/30ozSteak/KD-ND-Weatherly]
- [ReactJS, asynchronous javascript, managing state]

# Description

A sleek weather app that incorporates the weather underground API. May deprecate over the next few months as the API access will end in December 2018. And my first attempt at React. Once I cleared the hurdles of new syntax and working with components, it was a ton of fun and we were able finish up with a great product. I had some high def iPhoneX renders available and utilized them in the Readme, which really sealed the deal with it's overall aesthetic. I spent a lot of time staring at the React Docs, watching tutorials, and doing codealongs, and felt that my future React projects would benefit greatly.

# Evaluation Comments (B. Storoz)

- UI was well received
- All required functionality was presented in an elegant, easy to understand manner.

#### (World Citizen - With Justine Troyke and Alex Bruce)

- [https://github.com/30ozSteak/AB-ND-World-Citizen]
- [https://gentle-savannah-39287.herokuapp.com/]
- [ React, Ruby on Rails, OAuth, Jest , Enzyme, React Router ]

# Description

World Citizen is the gamification of giving back. Any time a user logs a purchase at a socially conscious company, they're rewarded with points, levels, and achievements. User can earn stickers, camera filters, discounts, and can compete with other nearby users (citizen's) to help make the world a better place!

A little over a month ago I was approached by a mod3 student, Justine Troyke, who had heard that I was someone who enjoyed making UI's, had a fairly good grasp on CSS, and was always willing to take on new projects. I helped provide some direction with her design, but the project was ultimately her own as it was her final project for the mod. She took the app to demo night, and came in third.

It was awesome.

I was so inspired by her passion and dedication to an app that is bigger than herself that I insisted on being brought on as an official contributor. She invited me to join her as her Lead Designer and I happily accepted the role. When week 4 of mod2 came around, and our mod was assigned Weathrly, I approached my instructor and brought up the possibility of working on this app instead of Weathrly. It was suggested to bring Alex Bruce, another former 1804 studen, onto the team as contributor. He accepted the role as Lead Developer, and we all got to work.

Justine built out complicated API endpoints for our app that allowed us to ping her database for queries on businesses that have a soscially concious business model. We utilized this and built a clean, elegant, modern UI for her app.

# Evaluation (B. Storoz)

- UI well received
- Our ability to walk into an existing codebase and turn an idea into an MVP product good enough to be shown off at Demo Night is super awesome and was also well received.
- More testing

## D: Community Participation

#### Overall

#### Meetups

I made an effort to attend more meetups this month, and an even stronger effort to engage with the other developers at those meetups. I attended meetups with the following groups over the last 7 weeks

Bootcampers Collective
Design Thinking at a Mile High
Denver Amazon Web Services Users Groups
Denver React
Denver All Things Data
Denver UX
UX Happy Hour in Denver

#### Top Talks

Week 1 of the new inning meant Turing Top Talks. I had done a lightning talk to 1806 students on CSS Grid and it was so well received that I was elected to do it infront of everyone. _Hurray_. In preparation for this, I had some fun and built my first HTML / CSS portfolio site that shows the power of manipulating structure of your webpage and managing state only using CSS.

- [https://30ozsteak.github.io/portfolio/]

I then presented a similar talk to 1808 demonstrating how visualizing your UI before writing any code you could easily utilize CSS grid to build powerful, engaging layouts. I was then selected to give _another_ top talk on the topic of UI/UX and CSS Grid to the next inning, the 1809 cycle.

# Evaluation Comments (1808)

- slow down a little bit

- TEACH ME YOUR WAYS GRID SENSEI

- But what about older browsers?!!??!

- steve jobs of turing

- No advice. Thank you for connecting it directly to things we are doing in class.

- Thought it was great! Seemed like maybe you had more to say when you hit time though, so just condensing a bit perhaps?

- Super engaging content. Context was huge. Everyone in mod1 wants grid, needs grid, so engagement wasn't an issue. Talk was structured more a like a lesson with the live coding and such. Would have been a great 10-15 minute talk but should have been tighter with a clearer message for 5 minutes.

- Amazing!

- glitter

- Very engaging, really enjoyed the subject and I have a much better understanding of grid. I want to know and see more!

- Eye contact with the audience Great use of the screens and walking back and forth to engage the audience.

- Good live demo

- Excellent! I can't think of any suggestions. Nailed it.

- Very knowledgeable on css!

- Great job, I wish I could get a grid lesson from you someday.

#### (Colorado Developer Showcase - With Alex Bruce)

Alex Bruce and I will be showcasing our inprogress MVP at Enterprise Coworking on October 11, 2018.
