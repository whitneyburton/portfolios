## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
I set out to:
- pass the module, and didn't
- learn rails, and did (to a mod 2 degree)
- learn how to collaborate on bigger project, mixed results

#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I struggled with collaboration, Professional Development, logistics, mental health/self care, and making myself do the things that are hard for me.
For collaboration, I think I did learn a lot, at least as much as I hoped to.
For the other things, as discussed, I didn't do well.  But even from our meeting and the rest of that process, I feel like I've started to make progress internally, and I'll continue to make that progress over my time off.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
My least favorite, was Bike Share, as discussed.
My very favorite would be Little Shop because it was a bit of redemption for me to work more effectively in team than I did in Bike Share.  Rails Mini-Project was also great because we had some freedom to decide what to do.

#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
Rails.  And that, when I didn't _have_ to use waffle, I missed waffle.

#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
In Bike Share I learned everything to not do, and in Little Shop I learned I could do better.

## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
My favorite gear-up was the "Parable of the Polygons"-based one.  It generated some good discussion, I heard some insights that were new to me, and I got the opportunity to argue (civilly) a point that's important to me.

#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I was a good friend to many people.  I also got a couple opportunities to debate important social issues, which is a somewhat rare opportunity.

#### What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Beyond what I'm doing now, I want to start doing a lot for the QueerQoders group.  If I'm taking a mod off of doing actual class, I'll have the freedom to contribute in ways that most students don't have time for.  I also want to be the first person 1710 comes to with problems, for the same reason but also because I want to get to know them better if I'll be joining them in mod 3, and because I won't be coding as much so I'll miss Ruby.
