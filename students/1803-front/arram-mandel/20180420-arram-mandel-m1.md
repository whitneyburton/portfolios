# (Arram Mandel) -M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This mod I set out to gain a solid foundational understanding of javascript and jquery. I also set out to improve my html and css knowledge to the point that I could design realistic looking websites. I also set out to gain the vocabulary necessary to articulate my code and any problems that could come up.

## A: End of Module Assessment

I believe I passed the end of module assessment overall


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Besides the static compositions, my only individual project was the number guesser. I believe it went well for a first project. There were clear opportunites for growth and I came away knowing what I needed to improve upon for the next project.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/airum82/am-number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project is a game that has you guess a number between 1-100. If you get the number right the range that the number can be increases. You can also set your own minimum and maximum range.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Our group projects consisted of the linked-list, ideabox and todobox. These projects built on eachother and the ability to work well with your partner was part of the grade. We were also graded on javascript/jquery functionality as well as html and css layout.)

#### (Linked-list)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JoOCon/AM-JO-Linked-List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

This project was meant to be a list of links to various sites that you want to save. You were supposed to be able to mark them as read and delete them. There was also supposed to be a running tally of how many links you have.

Feedback from Project partner:
You were a great partner. The general work flow was casual yet professional, productive, and respectful. Even when we hit hard spots in getting functionality you made sure to keep a clear eye on the goal. I felt that you did a great job with keeping in touch and you were very acceptant to goals we agreed upon. I honestly have little to critique, the only thing I could point out is to work on organizing naming conventions. We spoke to this a little during our project. I think it is more a thing that will improve with more practice. Over all, thanks for the great pair and helping me learn. Hope I did the same.

#### (Ideabox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Haub/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

This project was supposed to keep a list of various ideas you have and mark them with one of three qualities using up and downvote buttons. The ideas were supposed to be stored in local storage and persist on page reload. You could also use the delete button to remove them from local storage.

Feedback from Project partner:
Arram,  I enjoyed working with you on IdeaBox!  It was a challenging project and I thought we complemented each other well in trying to solve some of the problems we encountered.  I felt overwhelmed with other projects that week, and there were a couple points that I wish I could have devoted more time to it.  Thank you for taking extra time to get help from your mentor with it.  You have a great handle on JS and you really pick up things quickly!  I think both of our communication could have been a little stronger... but other than that,  I thought the project went well.  Great job!

#### (Todobox)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/airum82/AM-BT-2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

This project was supposed to improve upon someone else's ideabox. You were supposed to take their repository, refactor it and pivot it to be a list of chores that you could edit and mark as completed. The chores were supposed to be stored in local storage. You could also use the search bar to filter through the chores and return the ones you're looking for.

Feedback from Project partner:
Arram I wanted to take a moment and thank you for your time on the 2DoBox paring project. Your knowledge of jQuery and the understanding of the project scope was key to success of this project. I appreciated your communication and your relentless ability to search for the answer. I have no doubt that working with your current approach to the task at hand will make you successful in your time at Turing and as move forward in your career.
Thank You.

## D: Professional Skills

(These sessions were designed to help us maintain balance and avoid dangerous levels of stress while taking on this amount of work. They were also designed to address problems in the tech industry and approaches we can take to make them a little better.)

### Gear Up
#### (Mental Health 101)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

(While I went into this program knowing that it was going to be the bulk of my life, I quickly learned that I had to maintain a chunk of time for other things. I learned that it was more important now to keep exercising and eating right. I must take constant steps)

#### (Debugging the Gender gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

(I learned that despite best efforts, there are barriers in the development industry that still need to be broken down. I learnted that we must be proactive in making sure everyone feels included in the work environment and that a great web developer can come from anywhere. I continue to think about my own biases I may or may not be acting upon on some level)
(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

#### (Your phone as a civil rights issue)

(There was no github resource for this session)

(This session was about the growing privacy issues faced through online companies selling your information. When you're not charged for the product, you are the product. I learned that the user agreements need to written in a more clear way so users know what they are agreeing to. After the session I also continue to think that if there's a desire to not have your private information shared, then maybe the problem could be mitigated if we made it profitable to not share data. Many companies would come on board if there was profit to be made.)

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in all PD and Gearup sessions. I tried to learn something from each session and grow as a person. I helped my fellow students with their code whenever I could. And asked clarification questions in class for myself and others.
