# Kevin Krom - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to build a solid foundation in Javascript, HTML and CSS. I also really wanted to develop a growth mindset and push myself through things that I had previously thought impossible.

Passed


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Starting out working on your own was nice but was a bit daunting. With number guesser in particular, I remember being so overwhelemed but looking back, it looks so easy! I enjoy working from home late, and these projects really gave me the ability to work through things on my own.

#### Number Guesser 

*https://github.com/kevinkrom787/number-guessing-game-turing
*http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html


We were tasked with building an application that generates a random number that the user has to guess. It provides hints to if the user is too low or too high. It was fun to start working with numbers!


Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase two.

Fix Formatting Love that range check and number check are in separate functions

Proficient
Organized by type!

reload page- Js in html add aria label to input add aria-live to formTwo

#### Static Comp 1

(description)

Asked to build a website consiting of 8 boxes on the left of the page and a background image on the right. It was my first experience with grid and it didn't go extremely well but I started building the foundation of how to put together a website using grid and it taught me so much!


Make things more responsive. Don't delete your project 48 hours before it's due..


#### Static Comp 2 

*https://github.com/kevinkrom787/kk-comp-challenge-2
*http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html


Build a website that had a semi complex header and set of 8 cards that wrapped evenly around the bottom section of the page. I really embraced Flexbox on this comp and was pretty proud of the layout. It was my first decent mobile layout!

Watch out for the squirliness when shrinking screensizes.

#### Static Comp 3

This project was a monster. The biggest lesson and thing I'm most proud of is that I took a long time getting the grid foundation set up and it made everything so much easier down the road during responsive. Super proud of how it turned out despite not completing everything. 


Get better at naming.
Don't forget the details. My placeholder text should wrap around when screen shrinks.


Haven't received it yet!


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Working with others helped me understand that everybody struggles. It was also great to work through problems with other people and figure out that by talking outloud, I can get this! It was also nice to see how others approach a problem compared to me. 

#### Linked-List

*https://github.com/kevinkrom787/Linked-list 
*http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html


We had to build an application that stored user input on the DOM and had a few opportunities to toggle classes. Felt good to work through some of these challenges and was proud of the final product.

Style guides and tree shaking!!!


Novice: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.
Advanced Be: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two. // validations and responsiveness
Proficient: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.


Shake that tree! Make sure your code looks nice and that everything in your file needs to be there.


#### Idea-Box

*https://github.com/brianw11/IdeaBox
*http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Build an application that stores user input into local storage and can be edited and removed if need be. This one was super challenging and while I wasn't expecting a good grade, I learned a lot through this failure. 


Leverage console.log more to confirm that data is what we expect it to be


Novice Application meets all of the basic functional expectations of create, edit, delete, persist in local storage.


Advanced Beginner Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.

Proficient Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.


Advanced Beginner Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

Advanced Beginner Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.


Novice Can articulate the definitions of primitive data types: strings, booleans, numbers, null, and undefined. Can articulate and describe object types: objects, arrays.
Advanced Beginner Can diagnose when issues of data-type mismatch are present and appropriately redirect their coding and/or research efforts accordingly to solve the problem.

Moral of the story, we didn't do well...


## D: Professional Skills
It's great to practice things that you're going to be dealing with in the real world. I especially appreciate all the focus on getting a job and how to tell your story. 

### Gear Up
#### Mental Health

* https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md

Mental health has impacted my family first hand. It's awesome that Turing goes out of their way to prepare us to have these tough conversations before releasing us to the wild. I think the biggest take aways are that we shouldn't be uncomfortable discussing mental health. We should also help others feel more comfortable when discussing their own issues.

#### coding 2.0

I was actually just talking with a friend about how his company should have more than 2 gender roles on their application. The biggest takeaways from this were that it's my responsibilty as someone in power (white male) to help those who miight be marginalized by creating an enviornment where they feel comfortable speaking out. The tech world needs a lot of help and it's our responsibility to make it more inclusive when we go out into the real world. 


#### Tech in medicine.

The biggest take away from this was how many ethical questions we need to answer as a society before we can really start making headway. My biggest question during this gear up was how do we keep the data secure? That'll be an interest battle moving forward. 

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I listened a lot and did my best to learn as much as possible. Looking forward to building my brand and helping others now that I have a handle of this Javascript! I am excited to continue branding myself on social media and helping turing along the way. On a micro level, I tell everyone about Turing and am currently recruting pretty much everyone I know to become a software developer.
