## Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to learn as much as possible while maintaining a reasonable work/life balance. Though challenging, I believe I was successful in this pursuit.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Number Guesser

* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where the user guesses a number between 1 and 100.
Phase 4 is optional. If you execute phase 4, create a separate branch in Git for that work for evaluation (using Git is an extra challenge – investigate how to initialize a Git repo and make a branch! We’ll go over how to do this in class in a few days, so this is a great time to investigate on your own).

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)

Health and Wellness: 

Stress is a majoy part of being a student at Turing. How you deal with it can make or break your ability to get through each obstacle. This session helped prepare me for what was to come and ensured that in those moments where I was deciding between trying to get one more thing done, or taking time for myself, the latter won out.

Code 2.0

A diverse set of ideas and opinions is what makes an organization strong. This logic applies to programming. An industry that for that for the recent history has been predominantly white and male. As with anything, you need to have everyone in the room in order to make decisions that will affect everyone. 


Minfulness

The mindfullness was one of the most helpful gear ups of the mod. It is something I think time should be made for throughout the mod. Control over your thoughts is an incredibly important part of stress management. The 5 minute medidation is a great way to get control over your thoughts along with yoga. 

Given that companies like Apple and Google actively incorproate these practices into their cultue I think it would be smart for Turing to follow suit.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in and helped organize weekly study groups with my peers. I found that the only way to get through this is together. 

On the saturday before pentathalon I helpe organize a shopping list/mythical creatures study group at Skylab with Gavin. We used a whiteboard to talk through individual creatures and broke out into groups to work on shopping list. I really helped me feel confident in what I was doing because I could teach parts of it.
