# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  * I will learn another language in addition to Ruby this mod.
    * This was not a good goal to have. The content in this mod included SQL so in a way I did, but I feel like I should focus more on depth of Ruby and Rails knowledge before trying to learn a new language.
  * I will learn more about networks, cyber-security, and how the internet works
    * Couldn't help but learn these subjects! I did do my own exploration into data security this mod, and would like to continue learning more about these topics next mod.
  * Successfully complete all projects and get several 4s
    * I did successfully complete all projects, but I don't feel like any exceed expectations. The amount of knowledge and the body of work this mod has made me more comfortable meeting expectations, because the expectations are high.
  * Create something that can be included in a professional portfolio
    * Rails mini will definitely be going into my professional portfolio, after a bit of polishing
  * Start developing leads for jobs
    * I have added two excellent connections to my network this mod, and feel like I did start developing some leads

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  * The sheer amount of work can be hard to manage without a good system of organization. I found myself down several rabbit holes in Rails-mini and struggled with actually completing goals because I got distracted. Similarly in our timed challenges I would get sidetracked trying to make a specific thing work, and would occasionally run out of time before completing the challenge. I learned to step back, design in iterations, and focus on completing one task at a time.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  * I really enjoyed the creative freedom in Rails mini, and liked the overall concept and breadth of material in Job Tracker. I think that little shop and bike share are mismatched. Bike share should be analytics and activerecord, while little shop should be carts and sessions. I felt like bike share was too unfocused, and that only some of the group got practice building the important auth and cart code while others got stuck doing way too much activerecord.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  * Self pacing, organization, and a whole lot of styling. Rails mini dramatically changed my CSS skill levels.

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  * Project management and workflow. The codebases this mod were so much bigger, that there was no way to know all of your teammate's code. Being able to assign tasks, work independently, and then merge and review together was an excellent learning opportunity.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  * The mod 4 led gear-up was excellent this mod. The conversation about data privacy and security is extremely relevant and it was great to get a group of new developers together to talk about how we might impact the field as we start to get jobs. I felt like the feedback 2 session needed a more concrete deliverable and a more structured conversation. I had a conversation with my partners, but it was not as effective as I think it could have been.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  * I made myself available to mod 1 students for pairing pretty consistently. I also tried to reach out to more upper mod students to create connections and learn more.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  * I would like to continue mentoring the mod 1 and 2 students. In mod 1 I felt uncomfortable asking for upper mod student's time, so I would like to make myself available to others and make it easy for them to get support.
