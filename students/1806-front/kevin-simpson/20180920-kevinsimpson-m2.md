# Kevin Simpson - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this modules were simple: I wanted to gain a solid understanding of React and to nail down my array prototype methods. I feel like I accomplished both of these goals. My ability to look at data sets and to leverage the appropriate array prototype(s) to get the information that I want feels strong, and I feel that I have a solid grasp of the basics of React.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This Mod's projects felt like they were decidedly-less scaffolded than the previous Mod's, which I think made them feel more difficult. That aside, I feel very succesful in all of them.

#### (Complete-Me)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/relasine/complete-me)
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

This project was to make a working prefix-Trie that would take the populate(), suggest(), delete(), and select() methods. This project would later be used to create an NPM module to use inside of our Weathrly project.

(evaluation comments)
* Generally positive
* Was asked to figure out why the select() method wasn't returning the appropriate answers. Was quickly corrected after the eval.

(evaluation scores)
* None given

(feedback to me)
* I did a better job of taking my time than I had during the mid-mod.

## C: Group Work & Projects

#### Game Time

* [GitHub Repo](https://www.github.com/colehart/game-time)

* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

This project was to recreate the classic game Snake using object-oriented programming and HTML canvas.

(evaluation comments)
* invoke getInitials in makeNewScoreObj
* don't pass snake around, since it is a property of the game

#### Weatherly

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Project Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

Make working weather app in React with appropriate unit testing, to create and use an NPM module for auto-complete, and to fetch and use api data.

(evaluation comments)
* The code for suggest() was too verbose and it ran slowly
* Figure out why the localHost testing wasn't running

(evaluation scores)
* None given

(feedback to me)
* None given
* I was not personally thrilled with what my partner and I produced on this project. I was somewhat overwhelmed by the various new skills and techniques we were asked to deploy, and ended up with a product that I knew I could do better on.
* This week I completely redid the project as a phone app. The suggest() function is fast and smooth, I've built in better error detection, a loading screen, animated transitions, cleaned up the UI, and just generally made it far better than my first attempt.

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I paired with Mod1 students like it was my job this mod, running impromptu classes on DOM manipulation, running a Mythical Creatures review session with Chris, making myself available to help often, and generally finding every morning and lunch take consumed by a booked pairing. Additionally, I have taken on hosting the Turing podcast, for which I recorded my second episode today. I have additionally been asked to take on duties as the SAB rep for 1806 next inning, which I have accepted.
