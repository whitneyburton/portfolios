# Whitney Burton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Throughout Mod1, I set out to solidify a base of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through instruction, pairing with older mods and my mentor, and working with peers, I aimed to both learn and teach from others. I also set out to learn my own "struggle timer" - in the beginning of Mod1 I had less endurance and would want to ask for help from others realtively soon after hitting a wall. Once I realized this, I set out to build this endurance through learning better strategies for Googling the problem at hand, and figuring out how to utilize console.log's and debugging tools well.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Pass

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In Mod1 we had three personal static comps: Dog Party, static comp 1, and static comp 2.  We also had one individual project, Foto Finder.
 
#### Dog Party

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/dog-party)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/dog-party.html)

##### Description
Dog Party was our first projec to test our beginner HTML and CSS skills. The goal was to recreate the comp with semantic HTML and clean CSS. 

#### Static Comp 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/wb-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

##### Description
For this static comp we were challenged to recreate a responsive website which includes a nav bar and a series of 8 cards. This site had to be responsive to as low as 320 pixels wide. We were expected to reflect every small detail from the comp example including spacing, layout, and utilzing a good choice of color palette and photos/icons.

#### Static Comp 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/wb-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

##### Description
For this static comp we were challenged to recreate a fully responsive site which included multiple media queries. This site had to be responsive to as low as 320 pixels wide. We were expected to reflect every small detail from the comp example including spacing, layout, and utilzing a good choice of color palette and photos/icons.

#### Foto Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/wb-foto-finder)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/foto-finder-final.html)

##### Description
Foto Finder is a web application designed to store a user's photos. A photo card is made up a title, a caption, and a delete and "favorite" button, all of which are created and stored locally within a separate class (Foto). The localStorage objects are retrieved and placed on the DOM accordingly. Main funcationality includes: Creating and deleting photos, manipulating the "favorite" boolean value and sorting accordingly, and filtering photos through their title or caption. Foto-Finder is supported on mobile devices up to 320px wide.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Our group projects included Number Guesser and IdeaBox. 

#### Number Guesser 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/wb-number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser-doubles-wk2.html)

##### Description
Number Guesser was our first project using JavaScript. This web application allows a two users to play a game against each other where they try to guess the correct random number between their own set parameters. The two-player game displays the winner card on the right where it also logs how long it took for the users to guess the correct number, as well as how many guesses it took. 

##### Evaluation Comments 
watch indentation and stylistic consistency in code (html, css, and js)
HTML styling is very inconsistent
keep HTML and CSS naming modular and reusable
keep global variables to a minimum
UI is not responsive
UI needs a polish pass, watch spacing and small details

##### Evaluation Scores
Functional Expectations
* Novice: Application meets most of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished.
* Advanced Beginner: Application meets all of the expectations of phase one and execution of UI is somewhat unpolished but shows attention to detail.

#### IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whitneyburton/ideabox-triples)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox-triples.html)

##### Description
This is a web application designed to store a user's ideas. An idea is made up a title, a body, and a quality value, all of which are created and stored locally within a separate class. The localStorage objects are retrieved and placed on the DOM accordingly. Main funcationality includes: Creating and deleting ideas, manipulating the quality value, and filtering ideas via both a search and quality function. The Ideabox application is supported on mobile devices up to 320px wide.

##### Evaluation Comments 
HTML
* Forms should only be inputs with their associated buttons
CSS
* Good style and structure
* Leverage percentage widths over grid for less complex layouts
JS
* Consider where you can leverage parameters and arguments
* If there is no else, how could you leverage an else
* Grab the whole object from storage. Not individuals properties at once

##### Evaluation Scores
Functional Expectations
* Proficient - Applications adds 'Filtering by Importance' and 'Recent Ideas' as outlined in the spec
Comp Recreation
* Proficient - Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop and mobile (colors, fonts, icons,spacing, alignment, etc.) with smooth transitions between screen sizes. Additional elements added generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward
HTML - Style and Implementation
* Proficient - Applications adds to the above with markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions
CSS - Style and Implementation
* Proficient - Applications adds to the above by removing repetitive rules and blocks of code according to the DRY principle
JAVASCRIPT - Style and Implementation
* Proficient - Application adds readability by incorporating both DRY and SRP practices and students can speak to implementation decisions

## D: Community Participation

### Playing a Part
I felt I supported the larger community by:
* Staying late and arriving early to do as much work physically together on group projects 
* Being a leader in organizing pairings with older mods in my group projects, and encouraging others to pair as well
* Kept myself available on Slack at all times for communication with teammates and otherwise 
* Participating in all activities Turing provided as well as connecting with alum's outside of class time.
