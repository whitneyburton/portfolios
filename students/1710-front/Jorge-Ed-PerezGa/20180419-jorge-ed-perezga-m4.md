+## My Story
+
+Maya Angelou once said, “if one is lucky, a solitary fantasy can totally transform a million realities.”
+
+Today, every magical object can be a reality with technology. During my youth, my family and I traveled every year from Mexico City to the United States of America to visit Disneyland. For a long time, I believed every street, city, and state in U.S. was just like Disneyland, and personally that notion was more real than any actual form of the country.
+
+I have carried this whimsical blurring of reality with me through adulthood. When I go to the gym, a protein shake becomes so much more than pure powder, but rather, a magic potion that will make me stronger. I became curious about software programming when I was presented with the need to implement it into my artistic body of work. In the study and research of technology, I came across other artists that create enchanted objects: umbrellas that glow when it will rain, so that you do not have to check the weather; shoes that when you click your heels three times, trigger a gps signal that guides you home; and wallets that tighten when your bank account is running low. Through code, I aim to bring innovative ideas to my community, with a magically creative approach.
+
+What was your biggest achievement of the module?
+
+Staying true to who I am, while being open to become a kinder, stronger individual. I have found importance in fully dedicating myself to do my best work, while continue to seek help for disorders that, in the past, may have gotten in the way of me doing so.
+
+## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
+
+My biggest struggle has been juggling the tremendous load of work required at Turing, while trying to stay healthy physically and mentally. I have overcome this struggle by finding support in the Turing community, and believing that doing my best is truly good enough.
+
+## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?
+
+I have become the best at creating aesthetically beautiful applications.
+I have created meaningful connections with countless students and instructors.
+I have a unique perspective that allow me to stand up for others and be empathetic.
+
+## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?
+
+I feel limitless. I have the opportunity to create meaningful work; work that has no boundries. Today, I am someone that can learn and code, a skill that sets me free from all restrictions.
+
+## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
+
+My most important skills and lessons: 
+
+There is no competition with any other individual, but rather, the true competition is overcoming my own struggles and being resilient
+
+Life has a way of working things out, for the better
+
+Be thankful for the support you receive and don't take more than you give
+
+Anything is possible
