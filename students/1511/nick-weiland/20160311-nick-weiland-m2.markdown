## Community

### Giving Feedback

>**Alex** "I was really impressed with your work ethic throughout Rush Hour. I think some areas for improvement include making your workflow more seamless and becoming more confident in your ability to research, test and implement solutions to problems that come up by exploring documentation.  Also, I think you have some really great ideas and some of those ideas got steam-rolled throughout the project because of a lack of buy-in from the group and/or time constraints.  I think it would have been great if you took some of this ideas and put them into action and then demonstrated what you did as leverage for implementing into the project. Bias toward action.  Keep it up man."

>**Chelsea** “It was really great working with you and Alex on Rush Hour.  I think your future groups and future teams could really benefit from you speaking up more frequently in pairing sessions and being more assertive and vocal with project decisions.  I’d be happy to role play these situations with you if you’d like.   I was really impressed with your feature tests and your implementation of the Rush Hour sha encryption."

>**Marina** “I’ve seen such an awesome improvement in both your Ruby skill and confidence this module. All the times I worked with you over the past few weeks I was super impressed with your workflow and ruby logic.  I recommend continuing to reinforce your understanding how your code gets processed, similar to how we broke down the recursion  that was taking place in Bubble Sort on paper. You’re going to rock Mod 2!"

>**Ilana** “You have been an awesome addition to the Goldberg Posse. I feel like you're always positive and ready to work on Posse Challenges whenever time is scheduled.  Also, working with you on Ruby has been really fun and I look forward to more Posse Challenges next module.  In order to improve pairing sessions, I recommend getting to know your workflow super well and studying shortcuts/creating snippets to  make recurring tasks feel seamless.  Keep up the great work!"

### Being a Community Member

>"I really enjoyed working with Nick on RushHour. He excels at problem solving and really drove our progress in the project. He has a solid understanding of ActiveRecord, demonstrates good Ruby style, and has a solid understanding of styling. Occasionally I felt Alex and I were "left in the dust" on the project because Nick had a better understanding of the concepts. However, Nick was always happy to explain his code."-**Chelsea**

>"Honestly, I really don’t think there is anything I can really say as feedback for you since it always seems like you’re on point with what the challenges are. Other than that I really appreciate both of the times we ended up pairing up with both Rush Hour and the Mini Rails project that has been very valuable for me. Just analyzing how to react to certain solutions that seem so complex and finding the answers to it is very facisnating. I also appreciate how you would make all those shortcuts in order to make the workflow faster when it comes to implementing projects."-**Alex**

>"Nick took charge to complete posse challenges and would regularly be available for pairing. Being new to the style of the challenges, Nick was able to help me break down the problems into manageable solutions and together, we were able to work through portions of the challenges. I think that Nick is great at explaining concepts that seem complex as well."-**Ilana**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Continued to run Hack Design on Thursdays at lunch. Led student session on Design Thinking that may take place every other week.
* I worked with Deb Hamel 4/6 weeks on Fridays to go over Ruby by completing Exercisms.
