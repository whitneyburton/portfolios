## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
* I set out to try and learn the fundamentals of rails, beef up my knowledge of ruby, and lockdown a disciplined work regimen. Coming into the mod I did not start off well. I started to go through a depressive phase, which seems to occasionally occur, but I tried my best to not let this affect my studies to a large degree. I was able to continue with keeping to my normal schedule of waking up unnecessarily early to exercise, and still give myself enough time in the morning to work on projects or just to study (~1.5-2.5hrs) before classes started. This schedule is what I believe allowed me to get the fundamentals of rails down, but I will admit I did not beef up my knowledge of ruby. In fact my knowledge of ruby seemed to deteriorate over the mod. I may still be able to read ruby, but remembering how to use some of the methods I once knew is a struggle. Either way I attained my first and last goal of learning the fundamentals of rails, and lockdown a structured schedule.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
* I struggled with the workload, memorization of terms, and battling depression the first 3 - 4 weeks of the mod. I learned that with the massive workload, I can only do so much. I did not want to give up my sleep, which I was getting so little of already, or even my fitness regimen, which was the only thing that really kept me going through the mod psychologically. The workload, in all seriousness, wasn't all that bad, but it did seem like it at the moment. In regards to the memorization of terms, I have no problem with memorizing processes, such as setting up a migration, models, views, or controllers, but when I need to remember the technical terms for the 'checks for understanding' or just talking with my team, I would fumble to remember terms. To get over this I would just work through it. I would study a few things and read a few articles and try to saturate myself in the language of rails, so that if I spoke about it, I came off competent.

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

* My favorite projects were definitely bike-share and little shop. Those showed how amazing it could be working in a team that vibed well, and had complimentary skill sets / personalities. Little Shop was just a thrill to build, even though it seemed so hectic in the beginning. The project taught me a lot about myself and how I can contribute to a project in my own way with other teammates who were truly amazing in their skills and knowledge of the problem sets. Bike-shop was a thrill in that, our team was a well oiled machine. There was no downtime, and almost everything was accounted for in the end for functionality. I never felt lost nor that I was not able to contribute in some way to the project. The analytics were my favorite for sure.

* As for my least favorite project, it would have to be the rails mini project. I really let myself down. I had been going through some tough times during that project which really sapped all my energy, and left me in a state of anhedonia / lethargy. Really though, these are only excuses, and at the end of the day I really failed myself in the work I put forth. I knew I could better, knew I could have put more into the styling, the functionality, pretty much everything. Even if I have a personal problem, there is no real reason, barring physical complications, that my work / projects shouldn't be done.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

* I learned that I need to take into account all of the edgecases and check that my work is functional. With a paired project it is easy, because someone might remind me, but I have some difficulty with reminding myself to check for vulnerabilities and bugs as well as I should. For later independent projects I will have a checklist for what needs to be checked on each project. Functionality, edgecases, testing, etc. Also I will put it into my calendar as a regularly scheduled thing to go through the checklist. This will hold me accountable and hopefully make up for my lack of memory.

What did you learn from your paired projects?

* The most important thing I learned from my paired projects was that we all have something we can contribute. For Bike Shop I noticed that I spearheaded the styling of the project, while other parts of the project were partitioned off. If I was deficient in one area, I could rely on my partners, as we all had weaknesses in some areas and strengths in others that complimented each other. This was also true for Little Shop. I also learned to just trust my other teammates. My natural inclination in the past was to make sure that everyones work was up to par or functional, but I let go of the ego and would focus on my work. I had faith that my team could finish whatever work they had, and that was liberating.

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
* My favorite Gear Up was definitely the Agile Practices and Leadership Gear Up. This was very beneficial in that I was rather lacking in my knowledge of what true agile practices entailed. I also was not aware of the different working practices like Waterfall. With that gear up I feel that I am well equipped to answer most questions about agile practices and how I have worked with them. Another possible favorite would be the tragedy of the commons. That was extremely illuminating in how I should consider the diversity of users for an app and the importance of having a diverse group of people test it so that most if not all blindspots are accounted for.
* As for my least favorite, that is a hard question. I didn't necessarily find any of the gear ups to be unbearable, so when I say my least favorite, I am meaning the gear up that had little impact on me. The one that I really don't remember best. The feedback 2 was probably that for me. The gear seemed a little redundant with the previous session of giving feedback, but I do understand that there is a difference in giving written feedback and face to face feedback, so there is that. Overall though I felt that it could probably have been a little more structured or even included in the previous feedback session, but I am not really qualified to say so. I may be letting my bias through.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
* I made it a mission of mine to offer my help to anyone in the beginning of the module, but I will be honest, that I let that slip by. This doesn't mean I wouldn't pair with Mod 1 cohort members who asked though. I consistently would pair with some of the Module 1 cohort and help them through some tough problem sets. This was really my only contribution this module, but it was my goal from last module for sure.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
* I would like to continue offering my services and pairing time to the lower modules, while at the same time becoming more active in the posses. I would also like to begin connecting with other mods, other than the backend ones. I have little to no real relationship with the front end mod, besides a few different people, but going into the next mod I will make a concerted effort to put myself out there and meet others. Hopefully there will also be nifty pairs, and there could even be a slack channel for something like that, but we'll see. Either way I want to break even more out of my shell and become less introverted.
