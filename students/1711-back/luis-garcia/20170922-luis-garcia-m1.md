First Last - M2 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis
What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
  I set out to learn as much of the class material(rails) as possible, to learn how to build apps and build a study habit that forced me to learn more on my own rather than relying on other people and at the same time not get carried away on any single problem for to long. The first time around I doubted myself(kinda like how I always do) and stress myself out which leads to constant overthinking and errors, but this time around and besides the usual minor hick-ups that I've run into, I felt a lot more comfortable and confident and am glad I decided to take that break(even though I wouldn't have had a choice(dang wisdom teeth)).  


What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
  I felt like my struggles really began towards the end of week 3, where I felt like I all of a sudden needed to catch up. Be it some of the lessons that weren't taught in class and the technical difficulties we were having, plus the added pressure of our projects, the challenges I had to prep for, and everything in between, I began to get nervous and my mind started to get a little foggy. My main struggle here at Turing has always been to stay up to date with the class material, but at the same time I've learned and taught myself how to work better and stay caught up. Its not perfect and I haven't mastered it but little by little I suppose.

Projects
What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
  I enjoyed them all, but enjoyed the solo projects more. I felt more challenged to learn at a quicker pace.

What did you learn from your independent projects?
  I learned how to breakup the project into smaller and timed sections which allowed me to be more efficient. 

What did you learn from your paired projects?
  I learned to communicate through github and work remotely better than before.  


Community
What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
  Case Study with Mod 4
  I enjoyed this GearUp a lot, understanding that you can learn while you teach can be a double edged sword and very valuable.
  At some point we were asked to split up into groups and we each had five minutes to read an article and then teach it to one another. I found myself remembering and realizing how much I was able to recall because I had personal experience on the topic. It help me realize that by connecting real life experience with something new can help you learn things much quicker than you normally would.

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
  I paired with a few mod 1 students. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?
  Continue pairing with the mod students below me.
