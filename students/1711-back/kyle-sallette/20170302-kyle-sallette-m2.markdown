# First Last - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
My goal this mod was to continue forward on my journey to become a programmer.
I have really enjoyed mod 2 and working with rails and sinatra has been a lot
of fun. Being able now to create more of the frontend of your apps have really
been a blast and being able to share with friends and family members what your
working on and not having to explain what the a terminal is really works out. I would
I haven't been has successful has i would have wished but I will be back here next
mod with a smile on and ready to do it even better. And really just push myself to
the next level.


#### What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
I would say I struggled the most with the timed exercises. I really need to work more
on my speed and not let the stress of timed exercises completely break me down.
Because I know how important Being timely is when it comes to programming Professionally. I am
not going to be able to take hours to figure out something when I'm on someones payroll.
But I will get there with my speed and skills.

## Projects

#### What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
I would say Idea box. Really enjoyed that one because I had complete control
over all aspects of the project and felt like I really gained a lot of knowledge  
from having to do the entire project myself.
#### What did you learn from your independent projects?
Well to kinda touch on what I said above. I felt like the independent projects I gained
the most from because I had to figure out every aspect of the app. Also I got to
make design calls....even if they were not the right calls. But learned from that
and what to not do the next time.
#### What did you learn from your paired projects?
The ebb and flow thats so important in working as a team. Because I know in
the industry you are rarely going to be working on something yourself. I think Turing
does a great job at teaching you to be able to work as a team.
## Community

#### What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?
I would say my favorite was the community gear up. Really enjoyed the topic about introverts.
Even though I wouldnt consider my self a introvert. Took that class because I thought
it was a healthy thing to expose yourself to another way of seeing how people view
day to day life.
#### How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
I lent a helping hand to some mod 1 students when they reached out to me for help.
Which in the end really helped me out also because it made me realize that some of my ruby
was slipping and needed to polish up on it.
####What would you like to do to contribute next module?
I will be repeating mod 2. Even though I do have alot of things to work on myself.
I believe I can really lend a helping hand to some of the new mod 1 students coming into
mod 2 and also make sure To keep reaching down to the new mod 1 students coming into
Turing. Because I remember how scary that was for me.
