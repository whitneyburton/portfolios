# Elly Torres - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain the basic foundations of front-end development and start my shift in career towards programming. I only had practice using HTML and CSS before enrolling in Turing, and by the end of this mod, I  learn about the 'why' in programming and not just the 'how'.
