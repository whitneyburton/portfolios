## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)
I feel like I passed. I am dissapointed with my performance in the pentathalon, however I know the material well and feel like I would be comfortable moving on to new material in mod 2.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)
I am pround of my number guesser however my static comp 1 and 2 were lacking. 

#### (number guesser)

(description)
a simple app where a number is randomly generated and you must guess that number. you are given feedback if you are too high or too low until you guess correctly. it start between 1-100 and get harder when you guess correctly. you can also enter a custome range.

(evaluation comments)
Nice recreation of the comp - some adjustments and things to tighten up
Good job using semantic HTML
Add comments for organization in CSS. Look into BEM and SMACSS
Work on naming conventions for classes and JS.
Good job articulating what is happening in the code
Remove console logs before evals
AMAZING gif - nice surprise for winning!!!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)
I enjoyed all of the projects and strived to complete all aspects of phase 3 in all three projects

a bookmark creating website. 

(evaluation comments)

HTML
Nice work!

CSS
Consider using multiple classes where you have a more broad class for shared styles: ie. card-button
Love those organizational comments (maybe need less)
Organize within rules as you go

JS
Good naming for the most part, but always think about having the element type in the name if it is an element
Look at the style guides!

an idea list with local storage and search 

(evaluation comments)

HTML
dont forget that meta tag!

CSS
Consider adding organizational comments
always indent within media queries
consider utilizing min-width for containers

JS
love that you're using the data-id attr
Consider using arrays and leveraging indices to display text ie. qualities
Try using debugger more often to test things out
if you can pass an object as an argument, do so - instead of passing properties individually

Git/Github
Capitalize the subject line

(evaluation scores)

Functional Expectations
Advanced Beginner Application allows for upvote/downvote and enables searching/filtering as defined in the spec.
Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

(description)
the same as ideabox with a few extra features. we also were given existing non-working code and had to make functional while having no global variables and keeping our functions under 9 lines.

(evaluation comments)

nice UI, on mobile filter buttons should be same width as cards and inputs for consistency
HTML could use a little bit of a polish pass
JS has opportunities for additional refactor and DRY-ing up of code
good shared ownership of codebase, you are both able to speak to what it's doing and the thought process that went into it
