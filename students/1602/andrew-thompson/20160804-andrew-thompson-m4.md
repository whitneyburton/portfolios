### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 4.  

#### GameTime

**Warlords

* Assessor: Meeka
* [Github](https://github.com/drew-t/gametime)

Notes:
* Two different forms/repos for the multiplayer functionality
* Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors
* The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
* Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested. Testing is A+ on clientside - Testing is F- on Node.
* Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**Scores** 155/150

#### Scale Up

* Docker/Vagrant, AWS, Linux
* Set up a Docker development environment to see how that worked and set up rails engine in that environment.  Used docker-compose which does some cool stuff with setting up separate containers for Rails App and Postgre database and connecting them on its own.

Assessor: Meeka
* [Github](https://github.com/drew-t/independent_study)

Notes:

* Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.
* Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
* Developer logged 7 to 8 hours per working day. Developer can speak to work completed during those hours.
*  Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature whose next steps are not well documented.

### Giving Feedback

>**Josh Washke:**

>"Josh and I have worked on 2 projects together between Mod 3 and 4.  Both were great experiences.  He always does what he says he will and enjoys all facets of the projects (or at least doesn’t blatantly hate them like me).  The biggest issue I can think of is that often he will think of an idea and start to implement it without getting input from others first.  It’s not generally an issue so much as something where it would be nice to have some input and discussion about how something should work/look/turn out.  Really it’s pretty minor since the issue is with doing more work than necessary.  I would really appreciate the opportunity to work with Josh again in the future."

>**Jared Roth**

>"Gametime was the first time I worked with Jared on a project.  Overall he was great to work with.  He regularly asked for advice on different aspects and resources that we may have for certain parts of the game.  He worked tirelessly to perfect collision detection in the game, re-implementing it several times until he was happy with the result.  He also took the initiative to do some final styling and making the game setup correct.  In the end we had a badass game that wouldn’t have been nearly the success without his dedication."

### Being a Community Member

>"Coming in to GameTime, Drew knew he wanted to work behind the scenes. This clarity of desire and purpose really helped form the group dynamic as we divided our efforts. The flip side of that was that we (as an entire group) tended to work very independently. This became a problem towards the end as our work became more complex and we hadn't established effective communication up to that point. Although poor communication was an issue for everyone on the team and not any one member, it could be something for Drew to work on."-**Jared Roth**

>"We worked together on projects for 4 weeks almost back to back and I haven't gotten completely sick of you yet, so thats pretty high praise. You're a strong developer and are obviously passionate about back end and dev ops which is exciting to see. I would like to see you open your heart up to the front end a little bit more, even if you know you don't like working with it, being well rounded and familiar with the entire stack could be beneficial in your future career. Overall though I'm happy to work with you more as you are never afraid to dig into a difficult problem and are a pleasure to work with. 10/10 Would yell at you to fix shit again."-**Josh Washke**


### Playing a Part
