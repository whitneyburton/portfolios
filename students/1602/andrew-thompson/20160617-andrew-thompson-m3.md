Continue pushing myself to learn new things and take more chances.

### End of Module Assessment

**Challenge: Consume Best Buy API and serve up Storedom**

Assessed By: Nate

Result: PASS

##### Notes:
- Good use of VCR everywhere there's an external request
- Thank you for not committing your cassettes
- Tests could better cover the user stories as they've been written. Not testing for existence or absence of all the things mentioned.
- Try to avoid returning arrays and setting multiple variables. Not often used, and can confuse other developers
- Could use `require` in strong params to be more railsy
- No Model, forcing you to use your service in the controller

##### Scores:

* Ruby Style: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Testing: 3
* Progression: 3
* Workflow: 4

### Giving Feedback

>**Jeneve Parrish:** Jeneve was an enormous asset within our group.  She was always willing to take on the challenge of a part of the project even if she didn't necessarily know how to tackle it.  My recommendation for Jeneve would be to take charge.  She is so capable and works very hard.  I think it's easy for her to let someone else take on that role, but it may be beneficial for her to have a larger say in things than she sometimes provides.  Unless she is outright opposed to an idea, she will go with it, when I think quite often she may have a better idea but doesn't speak up.  I would definitely work with Jeneve in the future without any hesitation.  It was awesome to see her dedication to school and still being able to deal with having a family at home.  She did a great job (to my knowledge) of balancing everything.

>**Sunny Khalsa:** Sunny's personality was always a boon to be around.  He is always positive even when he's struggling.  The biggest issue that I ran into working with Sunny is his communication.  He will at times talk in circles about something, trying to describe something he's doing or why something isn't working correctly.  It's can be very confusing.  I think my biggest piece of advice to him is to slow down before he starts to explain complex ideas so that he has it straight in his own mind before he puts it into words for someone else.  This had a negative impact on the project at times because I would be frustrated with a lack of understanding of what Sunny was doing/working on.  It wasn't a flaw that ruined the project, by any means, just the most obvious thing he could work on.

>**Josh Washke:** Josh volunteered to take on a lot of the necessary javascript in our personal project, for which I am ever in his debt.  He was great to work with.  We both came together to discuss issues then went back to working on our separate parts of the project.  I really have no constructive criticism for him.  He will be awesome as long as he continues displaying the same level of dedication.

### Being a Community Member
>I really liked working with you and would welcome working with you again. You are a good leader in that you seemed to always understand the scope of the problem- sometimes when we were in the middle of it, I couldn't understand why you were weren't freaking out (like I was). But in retrospect, I can see that it was never as bad as I thought and you (somehow) knew that it was going to be okay; you were right. in a longer-term working relationship, your team will gain trust in your vision and the work will be much less stressful than the pivot was because of that trust. At the beginning of the project you said that one of your goals was to improve your TDD process; it turned out that the pivot wasn't the best sandbox for meeting that goal- I would encourage you to try that again in your personal projects- because I don't think you are as comfortable with that approach as you might become with more practice. -**Jeneve Parrish**

>I had a lot of fun working with you on our pivot project. You were really easy going and very open to collaboration, which isn't always qualities that strong coders have. You were also very accommodating with my wanting to take on unfamiliar territory, especially when it was new material that you were curious about as well. I am really grateful for that. Working with you also reveals that you have a good mix of skills that help drive projects without too many hiccups. For something constructive, I think there could have been better communication(definitely on my part as well), but with you taking on the role of project manager, I feel that entails a bit more of that responsibility to at least prompt communication and status checks. However, towards the end I feel that this considerably improved. -**Sunny Khalsa**
