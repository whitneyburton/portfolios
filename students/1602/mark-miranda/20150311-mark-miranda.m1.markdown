# Mark Miranda - M1 Portfolio


## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal is to build a solid foundation for the rest of my career at Turing
and into the rest of my career. I would like to create good habits and practices
to help solidify that foundation. I want to assimilate into the Turing community
and get as much out of this experience as I can.

### Giving Feedback


>**To Colin Osbourne:** Mark is extremely knowledgable and has a great logical way of tackling problems. Since most of what we did was him help guiding me through problems, I sadly can't give any feedback of what he can work on. But once again, he was super easy to work with. Communication was great, he great at giving me feedback so that was also helpful.

>**To Patrick Hardy:** Patrick is great to pair with. He is very collaborative and great at giving and receiving feedback or alternative solutions for problems. He seems dedicated to learning as much as he can and fully immersing himself in his ability to absorb concepts and information.


>**To Jared Roth:** Jared is great at breaking problems down into bite sized portions and really working through them one piece at a time. It was a weird short project that we don't actually need to finish, so yeah. Not too much feedback.

>**To Claudia Kiesenhofer:** Claudia is a great partner. She has a strong grasp on problem solving without tying it to programming, which makes the programming process so much easier. She is deeply rooted in TDD and has a strong attention to detail. I would love to partner with Claudia on other projects. It was great to work with her and I feel like we had a good understanding of each others' strengths and weaknesses before going into the project. Claudia could use a tiny bit of work on workflow and shortcuts (using the mouse less), but other than that, she was great to work with!



### Feedback to Me

>**From Patrick Hardy:** Mark is solidly engaged in the material and its always productive exploring code with him. He seems to have a good handle on everything covered in this exercise, and it was nice to have some extra time to talk out some project-related issues. More practice will get him where he wants to be

>**From Colin Osbourne:** Mark is extremely knowledgable and has a great logical way of tackling problems. Since most of what we did was him help guiding me through problems, I sadly can't give any feedback of what he can work on. But once again, he was super easy to work with. Communication was great, he great at giving me feedback so that was also helpful.

>**From Jared Roth:** Mark is great at keeping the overall objective in mind and ensuring that whatever we're working on is furthering that goal. While I was getting held up on how to best implement one relatively small aspect of the exercise, he was reminding me of what the time was trying to accomplish.

>**From Jeneve Parrish:** I’m really liking working with you. We are moving slow but I am optimistic that we will be happy we rebooted yesterday, and I know things will speed up from here. I really appreciate being given the chance to drive sometimes, and you have always been very patient and kind when I do. I have learned several short cuts from watching you drive too. Also, your spreadsheet-fu is unexpectedly super-useful in the project. Not least, I am having fun whenever we work together; your ability to put people at ease will take you a long way.

>**From Claudia Kiesenhofer:**  I very much enjoyed working with Mark on the project Hyde. It was very easy to set our goals and define the working process upfront and stick with it. Mark had a very good grasp on the assignment and was able to communicate clearly what steps he wanted to take when and why. At the same time he was open to all of my ideas for problem solving and working progress. Going into the project I was insecure about my workflow and wanted to work on this. Mark supported me by showing me multiple keyboard shortcuts and being patient me practicing them. We exchanged feedback throughout the project which allowed for a strong sense of mutual support and space for experimentation and creativity. This made the experience very relaxed and joyful. I learned so much on how to tackle a bigger problem, break it into manageable pieces and how to create erb and css files. I would love to work on other projects with Mark. The only thing I would do differently is to take a bit more initiative in writing methods during pairing session and to define and work on pieces independently. Thank you Mark for a great experience of collaborative work.

>**From Orion Osbourne (mentor):** I think your workflow and how you use the editor is solid.  I would recommend testing your assumptions more when you encounter a failing test.  I usually do this by throwing in a binding.pry right before where it's failing in the implementation and seeing if I get back what I expect. You're pretty solid overall though

### Playing a Part
* I am very active in the Dennis Ritchie Posse. I try to contribute to discussions and the logic of solving challenges despite not having as much code knowledge as the other posse members. It was very challenging at first to show up to a group of students that 1) I didn't know and 2) knew so much more than me and 3) knew I didn't know very much. They were all very welcoming of ideas and helped clarify ideas and concepts that we may not have covered just yet. Here are a list of my posse challenges:

  * [College Scorecard](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/posse_challenges/tree/master/college_scorecard)
  * [Code Breakers](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/posse_challenges/tree/master/codebreakers)
  * [Enumerables & Procs](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/posse_challenges/tree/master/enumerables_and_procs)
  * [People Database](https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/posse_challenges/tree/master/people_database)


* I have weekly screen hero mentor sessions with Travis Yoder and Orion Osbourne. We generally work on refactoring whatever current project I'm working on or work on Exercisms I'm not comfortable with or stuck on.


* I attended the 10-year anniversary of the National Association of Asian-American Professionals with the Turing counterpart (Turing Association of Asian-American Programmers). It has given me the opportunity to meet students from other cohorts, alumni and staff and discuss topics that may not affect Turing at large as an Asian-American.

* I am active in 1602 as a community member as well. I push to help us grow as a group and encourage each other to do well. I have offered to help other students understand concepts that may be unfamiliar. I have also printed stickers for the cohort to help identify and be proud of us as a group, while finding a way to not exclude students who may be repeating.
