# Ilana Corson - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

This being my first module, I wanted to emphasis ruby syntax and general basics of understanding. It was important for me to understand the fundamental logic pieces before jumping into larger problems. I struggled with the logic at the beginning but was able to overcome the mental block by working closely with my more experienced partners on projects.

### End of Module Assessment

I have decided to repeat the module to gain a better grasp of my fundamental Ruby skills.

### Attendance

I had to leave early a few days during the module but did not miss any full days.

### Individual Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Got stuck until last night. She's going to keep working at it. I emphasized organization and breaking down problems into managable pieces. Emphazied that we're looking for a trend of improvement.

##### 1. Functional Expectations
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
##### 2. Test-Driven Development
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
##### 5. Looping or Recursion
1: Application struggles to loop/recurse at all

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Assessed By: Meeka

Notes: Good spirit! You're getting there! The app was far from complete but I think given the weekend it could get there. What was present was test driven.

##### 1. Overall Functionality
1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage
##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
##### 3. Test-Driven Development
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.
##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Assessed by: Tess

notes: * Great tests

Broke out file io and a runner into separate files
One extension - auto updater

##### 1. Functional Expectations
4
##### 2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
##### 5. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
##### 6. Code Sanitation The output from rake sanitation:all shows...
4: Zero complaints

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GKhalsa/black_thursday)

* [DTR URL](https://gist.github.com/GKhalsa/de9860fb146376f69f79)

Notes:

Sales engine basic setup is good; maybe could have used some enumeration over the data hash to avoid some of the long argument lists
Don't use memoize if you dont need it (esp. in initialize methods)
Collection organization is good within the repos
Don't forget to utilize finder methods that were already defined instead of re-implementing them in multiple places
Really like extraction of analytics work into multiple dedicated classes for each one
Even could have gone farther in this direction by pushing some of the simpler, "1st-pass" methods into the respective Record classes (e.g. Merchant#average_item_price)
Appreciate the additional features -- glad to see yall are having fun with some programming
Tests are good -- got a lot of them, they cover the high level functionality; would love to see using at least fixtures (slimmer data set of some sort) or even some more hand-written simple ruby data
Esp. looking at the anlytics test, it covers the top-level interface; would love to see it covering more of the "under the hood" intermediate steps or other helper methods
##### 1. Functional Expectations
4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design
##### 2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
##### 5. Enumerable & Collections
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
##### 6. Code Sanitation
4: Zero complaints

### Feedback to Me

##### Pairing : Patrick Hardy

Ilana was a great partner. I also feel like our comprehension is at a similar level which makes working together go very smoothly. I thought we worked very quickly and are beginning to implement best practices and understanding how to select and structure methods. Both of us still have some confusion about communication between classes and instance variables or storing states. More practice will help Ilana be able to write programs more fluently.

##### Hyde Project : Matt DesMarteau

Ilana Corson and I paired up on a project together called Hyde, where we created a file system for managing and automating blog posts in markdown and converting them into HTML.  The project was only 5 days and we had to show determination and teamwork to get the work done.  Ilana was easy to work with and definitely wants to be a part of the work being done.  I appreciated when she would ask to take the drivers seat when she noticed I was frustrated with the project to keep up the group.  She is very genuine and honest when working in a team and it builds trust and accountability while working on a project together.  I knew she was very intelligent from the first day I met her and realized after working with her that she is very easy to get along with and would make a great asset to any team or company.  I know she is determined to improve her technical skills to gain more confidence over tough programming functionality to be successful within the industry, but you can’t teach great teamwork and that’s where Ilana will have an advantage over others in the industry.

##### Black Thursday Project:  Gurusundesh Khalsa


Ilana has grit man, while there are concepts about ruby that she doesn’t understand yet, she was with me every step of the way while working on black thursday. She was curious and determined to get the most that she could out of the project and eager to take charge. If  she continues with this firmness of purpose and uses this chance to repeat to her advantage I have no doubt she will do great.

## Community

### Posse challenges

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/weilandia/goldberg_posse_challenges)

I collaborated with my posse on a weekly basis. It was also a good support system to check in with on a daily basis.

I enjoyed the college scorecards challenge the most because it showed how to use CSV's and then we ended up using that in our Black Thursday project.

### Giving Feedback

* I delivered 100% of the requested feedback
