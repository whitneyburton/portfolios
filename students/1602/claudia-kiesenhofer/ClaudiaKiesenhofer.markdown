# Claudia Kiesenhofer Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into the first module I had three main goals. Having no experience with programing I first of all wanted to find out if I actually like programming and if I am capable and interested in understanding the concepts of programming languages. The second goal was to check out the community of programers and find out if feel I can thrive in this environment. Thirdly I wanted to really understand the concepts of Ruby and learn how to effectively use its rich library to create programs. At the end of module 1 I am very happy about the choice I made. I really enjoy programming and feel very much a part of this community already. I am still in progress reaching my third goal and realize it will probably take quite some time of practise to fully get there. I am satisfied with my progress so far.

### Mid-Module Assessment

* Ruby Syntax and API: 3  --  Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby)
* Ruby Style: 3  --  Developer writes code that is easy to follow)
* Blocks and Enumerables: 3  --  Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods)
* Testing: 3  --  Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks)
* Workflow: 2  --  Developer smoothly moves between tools, but is dependent entirely on mouse-driven interaction)
* Collaboration: 3  --  Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process)

Notes from Nate:
* Look up a couple keyboard shortcuts. http://blog.bugsnag.com/atom-editor-cheat-sheet
* I like that you're concerned with naming.

## Community

### Feedback to Me

Based on the feedback from staff and colleagues I focussed on two areas of improvement. The most important area of development was to break down complex problems into small manageable chunks. By writing pseudo code and tests upfront I practised to better understand how classes, their instances and methods are connected and which roles variables and arguments play and how to identify and use them. I have a better grasp at understanding and writing down code but need to keep practising. The goal is to work through the collection challenges on the Turing site over the next weeks. I also plan to offer help to first module students during module 2 to keep practising my understanding by explaining concepts to others. On the other hand I trained to increase the usage of keyboard short cuts and did typing practise to improve my workflow. Also here I need to practise more to get faster typing and will keep working on this in the next modules. 


Feedback from my project partners:

Claudia is a great partner. She has a strong grasp on problem solving without tying it to programming, which makes the programming process so much easier. She is deeply rooted in TDD and has a strong attention to detail. I would love to partner with Claudia on other projects. It was great to work with her and I feel like we had a good understanding of each others' strengths and weaknesses before going into the project. Claudia could use a tiny bit of work on workflow and shortcuts (using the mouse less), but other than that, she was great to work with!

Feedback after day 1 of collaboration on Black Thursday:
Working with Claudia on black thursday has been great so far! She is able to clearly communicate her thought process, which makes the experience feel highly collaborative. She is resourceful when troubleshooting issues and is developing a very strong grasp on OOD. I think she would benefit from writing more methods, and she does take initiative to do this. I think more practice will solidify her enumerable skills. Our approach so far has involved a lot of isolating ins/outs and I think this is helping both of us understand how to systematically debug and ensure compliance. It would be nice if we could make a strategy to split up more work, but so far the program has been difficult to parse into functional pieces.


### Giving Feedback

Feedback to my project parters:

I very much enjoyed working with Mark on the project Hyde. It was very easy to set our goals and define the working process upfront and stick with it. Mark had a very good grasp on the assignment and was able to communicate clearly what steps he wanted to take when and why. At the same time he was open to all of my ideas for problem solving and working progress. Going into the project I was insecure about my workflow and wanted to work on this. Mark supported me by showing me multiple keyboard shortcuts and being patient me practicing them. We exchanged feedback throughout the project which allowed for a strong sense of mutual support and space for experimentation and creativity. This made the experience very relaxed and joyful. I learned so much on how to tackle a bigger problem, break it into manageable pieces and how to create erb and css files. I would love to work on other projects with Mark. The only thing I would do differently is to take a bit more initiative in writing methods during pairing session and to define and work on pieces independently. Thank you Mark for a great experience of collaborative work.

Feedback to Patrick after day one of working on Black Thursday:
I really enjoy working with you on the project. It is easy for me to exchange ideas with you, because you are open to my input and good at listening and really trying to follow my train of thought - which I know is not always an easy task. You are good at explaining your ideas so I can follow along. It feels to me like we both contribute equally in the decision making process on how to design the project and how to move from step to step - which is great. I appreciate your hands-on approach trying things out and always checking on every single step with pry. It helps me understand the connection between input and output better. Two things I would like to discuss moving forward are to 1) focus more on writing the tests first - with pseudo code and 2) clarify who is driving what part of our pairing sessions. It seems to me that we get in each other’s way a bit when writing code and it might be better to assign this role for a certain time span in each pairing session. What do you think about these ideas? 


### Instructor Feedback

In week 5 I worked with Horace for an hour pairing session. This is his feedback:

* doing well mechanically -- pretty comfortable translating ideas into code 
* enums are ok -- doing well with basic looping; could keep adding to that toolbox over the next couple weeks
* biggest thing to focus on is going slower and breaking problems into small approachable pieces
* seems like once we identify what the small piece is you are able to get it done pretty easily, so we just need ot get to that point more quickly
* need to start annotating our methods -- what is the input and what is the output
* dont write code until you have a) a test b) somewhat detailed pseudocode describing the process we need
* once we do this it will start to make the testing much more effective
* still a little hung up on method receivers vs args "pizza".our_method -> our_object.our_method("pizza")


### Blog Post

I wrote the following blog post about my first project Junglebeats:

### Posse Challenges

We met on most mornings throughout the module to work on the posse challenges. I really enjoyed working with the group. I felt welcome right away. I liked these challenges also because they gave me a great direct feedback on my learning progress. I could contribute so much more with every passing week. Towards the end of the module most of my posse members were busy with their own projects and didn't have much surplus to meet. Going into the next module I am planning to reach out more to my posse to see how we can get connected better so we can utilize the resources of the group more effectivly. 

* Challenge week one: https://github.com/brianrip/posse_challenges/tree/master/people_db
* Challenge week two: https://github.com/thompickett/codebreaker
* Challenge week three: https://github.com/Salvi6God/Enumerables
* Challenge week four: https://github.com/brianrip/posse_challenges/tree/master/college_scorecard


### Project DTR 

I worked with Patrick Hardy on the project Black Thursday. During our DTR conversation in the beginning of the project we determined the folloging:

Goals for the projects:
* Complete the project on time with the needed grades for passing the modules (all 3s)
* Improve our weaknesses and support the other with our strengths.
* We want to do a good conceptual setup of the project upfront.

Weaknessans and strengths:
* It seems our weaknesses/strength are very complementary.
* Patrick wants to be more thorough with set up of tests and the upfront design of the project before diving into the process of writing. I often take too much time with the conceptual part of the project and need to start writing things down faster.
* I am having trouble breaking things down in small pieces and translating it into code. Patrick is very comfortable with this and is happy to support my understanding.
* We both want to find good ways to work together as well as splitting up parts of the projects.

We identified the following learning goals:
* get more comfortable with the use of hashes, enumerables and arrays
* improve writing and using tests: get full coverage, be explicit with naming tests, always write them before the methods
* improve on general workflow and git workflow
* switch off typing and driving the project

Conditions for best work:
* open communication idially in person. Express both satisfaction and possible points for frictions right away.
* shared motivation to do our best and to give the project a very high s

Schedules and pairing time:
* Our schedules are very flexible. Outside of class time we can work until about 6pm at school and screen hero in the eveing if necessary.
* We plan to also work on the weekend.
* We can do additional work in the morning before school and during lunch break if it is necessary.


### Pull Request
During my collaborative projects my partners and I paired for most of the time. Detailed pull request comments were usually not necessary. Here are two examples of more detailed pull requests.

* https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/hyde/pull/17
* https://github.com/Claudia108/black_thursday/pull/28
