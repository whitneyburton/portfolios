# Alireza Jace Andersen - M2 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

"Believe in yourself!" Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy *Norman Vincent Peale*

*Norman Vicent Peale* states it best, Belive in yourself and Have Faith in your abilities. I felt more confident then ever entering Module 2 and Kept feeling strong throughout the Module. Every Struggle I faced I was able to over come with a stronger understanding and just wanted to absorb more knowledge. Being able to see Programs in action is a great feeling. I constantly go back and improve some of the programs I made before.

I am super grateful for being able to learn the skills I have picked up on and am confident that my abilities that I have gained will set me up for Module 3. I had to retake my assessment and on my second attempt I pondered a lot with the feedback given to me. After reflecting on the feedback I came home to learn and improve from what was given to me during my feedback. To my surprise my logic was completely right and the feedback giving to me lost more validity.
A very knowledgeable Programmer told me that "Programming is like Art, people have different styles and some styles don't match up". Not saying that feedback giving to me was inaccurate but I truly believe that my way around the logic is correct. As the module progressed, my competence has grown substantially. This is reflected in the progressive improvement of the projects I've worked on, and contributes to my eagerness to take on Module 3.

I stated in my last Portfolio that I know the educators want me to be successful and I have put my entire faith and career in their hands. I look forward to continuing this program, obtaining this knowledge, and becoming a proud alumni of Turing School of Software and Design.

Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive. *Leah LaBelle*

### Feedback to Me

"Working with Ali on the project Rush Hour was great. Ali had some prior experience with SQL that proved invaluable to the group. Ali is patient an empathetic, a quick-thinker and hard-working. I’d welcome the opportunity to  work with him again!" Jeneve Parrish

"Ali was an integral part of our Little Shop team.  He took on a role of team lead scheduling tasks and keeping on top of tasks for everyone.  He also went back and forth helping with all tasks on the project.  Ali was very passionate about the project throughout, occasionally to the point of causing problems.  It was very tough to balance what we wanted to do with the project vs what was being assigned in waffles.  Ali often wanted to add features outside of that scope which would have been great, but they also could have been time sucks.  We were able to get past that issue though and worked great together." - Drew Thompson


"Ali “The man, the myth, the legend” Andersen.  Working with Ali on Little Shop has been one of the best experiences I’ve had at Turing.  Everyday as we’re working I can see just how much he cares about what he’s doing here at Turing.  He strives to learn, and actively goes out of his way to participate in areas he feels he’s not up to par in. In my eyes, he’s genuinely the most real, honest and caring individual at Turing.  No matter how he’s feeling, or how things have gone for him, he’s always taken the time to encourage me and tell me how far I’m going to get, which is something I’ve never really experienced from anyone other than my parents.  Even during a time of struggle, Ali goes out of his way to make sure others know how much they are valued and how much he thinks they can succeed.  Ali has proven himself to be exactly the kind of person Turing strives for. Turing’s view on community-driven education states three core values: love, respect and curiosity.  Ali embodies all three.

From Turing's website:

"Love is the energy of students guiding and mentoring each other."  Ali has been an incredible mentor to me since I first got to know him. He has never failed to provide encouragement, professional insight, and personal advice whenever I need it (as well as when I don't).

"Respect values people. Respect values perspectives. Respect is the understanding that we're here to do our best work — sometimes we succeed and sometimes we fail. Respect is believing that each of us can become more than we are today."  Ali brings such a high level of professionalism and respect to his group projects that makes pairing with him a fantastic experience.  I can't think of anyone I would like to partner with more than Ali.  His generosity and work ethic cultivate an environment where everyone is heard and everyone is valued.

"Curiosity begs us to ask "What if?" Curiosity asks us "Why not?" And curiosity challenges us with "if not me, then who? If not now, then when?""  Ali's desire to learn and challenge notions we take for granted provide a refreshing new perspective on both work and life in general.  He's never afraid to speak his mind, and stand up for what he believes in, a trait that's been discussed at length here at Turing, and yet I feel is far too scarce among our peers.  If no one stands up for what they believe in, then nothing will ever be right.

The roughest roads often lead to the top.  In other words Ali, you're on your way up. See you there." - Jon Liss

" Ali has been such an important part of my support system. He has consistently reached out to me when he has seen me struggling, and his kindness knows no bounds. Not only is he extremely empathic, but his skill level and effective pedagogical style make him a fantastic tutor. He helped me a lot with Enigma, and really walked me through an understanding of the method I needed. I would have not been able to get as far as I did without his help. Ali is truly an asset to the Turing community and I am privileged to know him." - Sonia Gupta

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:


Jeneve,

Working with you has been a remarkable experience and I hope to have the opportunity to pair with you on another project. I know from experience that it can’t be easy juggling a family and school. You are so skilled at what you do. Pairing with was amazing. Your logic and approach are so unique and great! You design and work flow are stellar and your patience with working with the 3 of us was impressive. Every time I think of TDD i think of you and how proud you would be of me implementing it as my first step. I know you will be super successful in your career and will make a everlasting impression in this field. I guess if I have to give you some constructive feed back it will be nothing at all! I think your a great programmer Jeneve!

Jon Liss,

Liss-is-more which is the perfect way to describe Jon Liss. He is by far the most knowledgable person that I have met at turing. What makes Liss-is-more is that he is barely in the beginning of his career and yet he is so far ahead of the professionals.  His passion and dedication to learning is amazing. One language isn’t enough for him and the challenge of learning more is what he strives for. Pairing with Jon is fantastic, he mindset is not the typical programmer who only thinks of code, but of the client perspective and consumers perspective. On a personal note Jon is a great guy. He has a good heart and goes out of his way to help others who struggle. His passion for programming not only comes for his love of the industry but from the good that he can do with it. You should ask him what he plans on doing with his knowledge. Turing should be super grateful to have such a great guy like Jonathon Liss. I know he will leave a legacy of good in the world with his code. #LiSs-Is-MoRe!

Sal,

Sal! What can I say bud! Havard has to be proud to have had a student like you! Working with you was such a pleasure. I think you do a good job keeping calm with all of the different approaches that came in a group of 4 in our project. I see your future exploding in this field and know that someday in the near future you will leave your legacy in this industry. I guess my only constructive feedback is that sometimes i saw you struggle a bit with so many different ideas from the group. I think you should listen a bit more to different peoples perspectives before deciding on which direction to go maybe helpful in the future. I look forward to working on the million dollar idea with you.
