# Joshua Washke - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Entering into Mod 2 I was mostly excited about getting to take my programs out of the terminal.
My focus during the mod was mostly absorbing as much information as possible and getting a solid
foundation in Rails and Active Record.

My other main focus was to work on my pairing skills. I'm not a very social person by nature so its
important to me that I am able to work in a team setting. For this I focused on providing several pairing sessions for 1603
students, and trying to not only succeed in group projects, but foster a better team culture, and learning enviroment for everyone involved.

### Posse

If you're in a posse - please include:

a blurb about what you did with your posse over the module
your favorite thing about the posse experience
how has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?

I was a member of the Armstrong Elixir Posse this module. Ultimately I'm very happy with the new posse structure.
I learned a lot and everyone present was enthusiastic about being apart of the posse and learning Elixir.

Over the module we worked on Elixir exercisms and studying from the Programming Elixir book.
I focused less on the posse over the last two weeks of the module as I didn't feel as comfortable as I wanted to in Rails
so I focused on studying more Rails instead of Elixir. Overall I enjoyed me time with the posse and look forward to continuing with them next module.

## Team

### Projects

#### Rush Hour

[Eval Notes](https://gist.github.com/jwashke/5e99e105a42958f5bd93ca195abfa4b4)
[Bonus Jim Ray Eval Notes](https://gist.github.com/jwashke/b62a3a50d41648ef44653951607cd4f9)
[Github URL](https://github.com/jwashke/rush-hour)

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills base expectations
2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
6. View Layer

3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

Workflow (NOT GRADED)

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Little Shop

With Sunny and Jared

[Github URL](https://github.com/JaredRoth/little_shop)

* Refactor edit and new item form into partial
* clean up tests a little
  * use
  ```
    item_1, item_2 = create_list(:item, 2)
  ```
  * instead of
  ```
    create_list(:item, 2)
    item_1 = Item.first
    item_2 = Item.last
  ```
* When creating order use new instead of create. We still tried to save the item
  but if something went wrong the item would persist in the database.

## Evaluation Process

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

### 1. Feature Completeness

* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions

### 2. Views

* 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

### 3. Controllers

* 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

### 4. Models

* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features

### 5. Testing

* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels

### 6. Usability

* 4: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers

### 7. Workflow

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

### Giving Feedback

* Jared, you’re a strong programmer who obviously knows what he’s doing when it comes to Ruby and Rails, Although I wish the circumstances of our group project weren’t so terrible for you, I have zero reservations about working with you. I think working remotely with you helped us both develop a strong workflow in git and projects in general. I think our project went excellent and would love to work with you again. Thanks!

* Sunny, working with you on Little shop was a treat. Working with for a short time quickly reveals you have a strong enthusiasm and curiosity for programming, two traits that I think will carry you very far in the field. We have very similar learning styles in our need to dig into code and really understand how its working, rather than trusting that it works implicitly. The only constructive feedback I can give you is to take care in your ambitions when it comes to projects. You have really excellent ideas, and I think that enthusiasm will help you as I feel the best way to learn is to get in over your head, but when under a time crunch its important to not commit to too many or too ambitious ideas. Overall though I don’t think that affected the project any in any way, just hope its something you keep in mind in future projects. I think our project went fantastic and would love to work with you again in the future.

* Deb! It was awesome to work with you again on Rush Hour. You continue to develop into a stronger programmer every time I work with you. I feel like I’m endlessly repeating myself but work on that confidence! Its obvious you have ideas for how to implement things but have a difficult time typing out your opinions in code when you think someone is watching. Know that your group mates aren’t judging you and that hearing more opinions and ways of doing something is a great way to learn and can only help when in a group situation. You are way better at this than you think you are. Work on believing you can do this, because I’ve spent a lot of time watching you code over the last 2 modules and I know you can.

* Matt! Working on Rush Hour with you was a great experience. You are obviously a strong coder though I disagree with your usage of Vim mode in Atom, even though I know I should probably learn Vim. You also bring a positive attitude to all your interactions that I found both energized, and tampered my frustrations while working on the project. I think coding ability and attitude you bring to any group is summed up well by the success of our rush hour project and I honestly have nothing but good things to say about working with you. I hope we get paired up again next mod.

### Being a Community Member

* Josh has a great grasp of ruby, rails, and programming in general. He understands project structure and relationships well and is thus able to implement new features in the appropriate place without difficulty. Being forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that it strengthened his git workflow tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us. **Jared**

* Working with Josh is a surreal experience. Things just work. You want to try some crazy feature, it's going to work. You want to try xyz, yeah they are going to work too. But it's not magic, it's because he has a fierce programming toolkit with a debugging prowess that will make your head spin. Josh is extremely capable, but at the same time he is always willing to hear out other ideas or go down different routes of curiosity that his teammates might have. Super humble dude. Something something constructive criticism I have no Idea. **Sunny**

* I paired with Josh on the Rush Hour project and like every other project I have worked on with Josh, he is extraordinary. He consistently demonstrates advanced skills in project management, coding ( in multiple languages) and an ability to instantly absorb and become efficient with new techniques. He is also a great teacher, patient with pairing partners and  one of the kindest people in our cohort - although a bit under the radar. Like to see him come out of his shell more, but feel SO lucky to consider him my friend. **Deb**

* "Josh is like a programming steam train that calmly crushes code at a steady, but nigh unstoppable, pace - and it is a great ride to be on. At the onset of Rush Hour, he verbally mapped out what our approach should be, and we proceeded to follow that plan to the 'T'. At every turn, it felt as though he was prepared with the exact proper response to the project's challenges - and was immensely communicative of his rationale and logic throughout each twist / iteration. Working with him was fantastic and helped me to improve both my logic and understanding of the MVC design pattern" **Matt**

* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

**3**

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.
* 1: Student does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

but does not do anything else of significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses just on their own learning.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

**3**

* 4: Student helps others to be their best selves while using peer feedback
to shape their own character and behavior.
* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.
