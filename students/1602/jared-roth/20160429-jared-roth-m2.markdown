### End of Module Assessment

### Attendance
Missed a few days out of the last two weeks due to a death in the family.

## Team

### Posse
This module, I was a prat of Hamilton Posse. Our goal was to build an iPhone app using React Native, a framework that lets you write JavaScript and React that compiles to run natively on either iOS or Android.

React and React Native was completely new to all of us and JavaScript was completely new to almost all of us, so there was a steep learning curve. Trying to figure out all of these interconnected technologies on the fly without any guidance was quite challenging, but definitely made us stronger developers in the end.

### Projects

#### Rush Hour

Rush Hour takes website traffic from multiple domains and analyzes it in various ways.

###### Comments:

Great project overall, next time, focus on naming tests better, testing in particular to get the most out of it, opportunities for refactoring in the server, breaking out logic from controllers.  Pull apart telling it what to do as opposed to asking it things.  

###### Scores:

__1. Functional Expectations__

 * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

__2. Test-Driven Development__

 * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

__3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components__

 * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

__4. Fundamental Ruby & Style__

 * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

__5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic__

 * 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

__6. View Layer__

 * 3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

__Workflow (NOT GRADED)__

 * 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/JaredRoth/little_shop)

Little Shop is an ground-up implementation of an online store.

Assessed By: Rachel

###### Scores:


__1. Feature Completeness__

__2. Views__

* 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present

__3. Controllers__

* 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack

__4. Models__

### Giving Feedback

* Claudia Kiesenhofer
>Working with Claudia, I noticed a strong desire to completely understand each piece of the project before moving on. This is a great asset to her learning. On this same note, it sometimes prevented us from moving forward when others _did_ know how to proceed. My only advice on this point would just to be a little more willing to allow others to try out an idea even if she doesn't fully understand it. Allow them to demonstrate how it works sometimes rather than only relying on verbal explanation.

* Josh Washke
>Josh has a great grasp of ruby, rails, and programming in general. He understands project structure and relationships well and is thus able to implement new features in the appropriate place without difficulty. Being forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that it strengthened his git workflow tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us.

* Gurusundesh Khalsa
>Sunny is exceptionally easy to work with. He always makes it a point to ensure that you know you've been heard when discussing potentially opposing views on a topic before offering his counterpoint. Since we were forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that his git workflow was improved tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us and establishing best practices for distributed projects. This is one area I can see easy growth in the near future.

### Being a Community Member

* Claudia Kiesenhofer
>I really enjoyed working with both of you. It felt very easy to plan out the project and make decisions along the way looking at different option and come to a common place. I especially enjoyed our effort to find appropriate active record methods for all queries. I appreciated the way how you, Jared, articulated your thought processes in a way that it was easy to follow. Kris, it was amazing to see how you would constantly research on questions we had and create some of the views parallel to what we were working on. Our working style felt relaxed and effective at the same time. The only thing I would change is to  actively seek out more times to drive writing code. Thank you for a great group project experience

* Josh Washke
>Jared, you’re a strong programmer who obviously knows what he’s doing when it comes to Ruby and Rails, Although I wish the circumstances of our group project weren’t so terrible for you, I have zero reservations about working with you. I think working remotely with you helped us both develop a strong workflow in git and projects in general. I think our project went excellent and would love to work with you again. Thanks!

* Gurusundesh Khalsa
>I'm so impressed with Jared. I mean seriously, he had a lot of huge life events take place during our project. He had to leave for 4 days, I'm sure he had a ton on his mind. Yet... I felt like he was always there. It is incredible. You could show him 5 pull requests and then all of a sudden he was completely on board, showing us potential bugs with a total understanding of the project. He has a plethora of good ideas and always knows how to implement tricky things. Super solid programmer.

In the first week of the module I, along with Drew Thompson, led an elective for new students to help get them acquainted with system and editor shortcuts, bash profile setups, and other useful productivity tools.
