# Christopher Soden - M3 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I want to continue to develop my skills in Rails and Web Development and learn to work with APIs. I want to continue to improve my typing speed. APIs are obviously going to be a huge part of almost any professional service.

### End of Module Assessment

Student: Chris Soden

Notes:

* Already talked about needing to define format for your internal API.
* Great feature test for the first consumption user story
* Great test for the second one too
* Service is functional and well broken out
* Could DRY service out. Also, what's going on with the '%' characters?
* Hard coded total stores value. Sneaky.
* Can't use hashes in the view. Should be using model to turn Stores into Objects
* Good work getting both API consumption user stories done

* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

A an exercise in MultiTenancy. We took a single e-commerce site and modified it to a multi-tenant application for auctioning items. The problem turned out to be more challenging than it seemed at first. An auction site is such a different paradigm from a straight purchase. We weren't able to retain any of the shopping cart functionality from the previous project. Each item is it's own sale, and it has it's own end date independent of other items. We might have been able to morph that code into something like a wish list or a watch list, but that was beyond the scope of the immediate problem.
Another challenge was setting up a mechanism for the site to automatically close the auction on schedule. We set up a rake task and used the heroku scheduler to run the task. The heroku scheduler is not very reliable; a more effective method would have been needed if this feature was going to be business critical.

Notes:

- Great workflow and git processes including comments, well written stories, and associating merged pull requests with original stories.

The goal of this project is to practice serving an API. One of the new concepts introduced involved structuring the app. We only used basic CRUD actions. Most controllers only had `index` and `show` actions for the endpoint data that was going to be requested. This meant creating a large number of controllers for all the different data that was served. The reason for this makes good sense, having such a clear structure makes it easy to find which controller is providing a certain data set when changes need to be made in the future.
We used jBuilder to design and structure our views/endpoints.

Evaluator: Nate

Notes:

- Break up model logic tests from controller tests
- jbuilder partials have the same problems as erb partials. Each one gets logged.
- Good routes talk
- You're not wrong -The Dude

This project is an app for coaches to manage their teams. The intended audience is coaches for Little League teams. The app employs OAuth to allow a coach to sign in using a Facebook account. The coach input the names and phone numbers of their players and once the names are saved the app sends a "welcome" text message to the phone numbers using the Twilio service. The app also allows coaches to edit the names and phone numbers of the players after the team is created.

Assessor: Josh

Notes:

* Nice job completing user stories
* Great Organization
* Like breaking up of the Twilio Service
* Testing would benefit from using database cleaner (Avdi Grimm's blog post)

* Deleting all players that belong to a team and then recreating them instead of updating existing records.
* Obtrusive Javascript

### Giving Feedback

To Erin Greenhalgh:
Erin, you did a great job organizing and managing our project. I really appreciate how you always kept us on track, making sure we followed procedure even when we were inclined to rush ahead. The high scores we got on Organization and Git Workflow are definitely a product of your leadership. I’m very impressed with all the hard work you put in, especially on the machine learning. You are also a very cheerful, friendly, person and a pleasure to work with.

To Brian Sayler:
Brian, I really enjoyed working with you. You have an outstanding work-ethic and you are a consistently positive person to work with. You are always looking for ways to contribute to the group and to the project. I’m particularly impressed with all the styling work you did. It stands out in the excellent appearance of the site.

### Being a Community Member

From Brian Sayler
Things I've really liked:
I like Chris' keen ability to get help when he needs it. Many times during the project, he would mention to us that he paired on a particular problem he was having, and ended up solving the issue and brought that knowledge to the group. I encourage Chris to keep doing this going forward: not only does it ensure that the project moves forward, but drawing on outside resources can be a huge help when there is a lot of work to do, and the other team members might not be available to help. Keep it up.
I've been impressed with the code that Chris brings to the group as an individual contributor. I think this is Chris' strongest skill: the ability to approach a particular problem and focus hard on that problem to get it done. Many time Chris would come to the group with a particular large amount of code that solved an important problem (e.g. the permissions service), and the group was always glad to hear that he had solved that issue.

    Constructive Criticism:
I'd like to see Chris be more vocal in planning discussions, when white-boarding, and every other non-coding aspect of these projects. There were moments where he had good ideas, but we had to ask him for input. I encourage Chris to speak up more about what's on his mind: your teammates cannot know what's going on in your head unless you let them know!
I encourage Chris to be a little more willing to make decisions regarding what he wants to work on, or how to drive the project forward. I appreciated that Chris would defer to the team when finding out what to work on next. I realized a couple days into the project that Chris enjoys being an "implementer" and doesn't jump on opportunities to be a "decision maker." He is most effective when the team decides what problem to approach, and he willingly tackles that problem. Chris has a strong ability to problem-solve, but he is most comfortable approaching those problems on his own. In future group projects, I encourage Chris to let his team members know about his tendency to be an effective "implementer," but that he also would like to work on increasing his participation in the decision making process.

From Erin Greenhalgh: It was great to work with Chris because of his solid understanding of Rails. He added some nice, nuanced self-referential table queries that helped our code be more readable and clear. I also appreciate Chris's willingness to diligently work on a problem until it is completed. Chris has some great ideas regarding app structure, and I wish he would be more communicative with the team regarding these ideas. At times I wasn't sure what Chris's thought process regarding s problem was, and I would have loved to have more of a dialogue and hear his opinions.

### Playing a Part

* I mentored a small team of high school students during the CTIA program at Turing.
* I assisted my classmates in solving problems they had run into in their code. And I received assistance at times from other classmates.
