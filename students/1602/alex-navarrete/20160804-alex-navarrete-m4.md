## Areas of Emphasis
My mission in module 4 was to be able to handle the last six weeks at Turing by going the extra mile when it came time to doing my projects. I made sure to always come to class and give it the best that I got when it came down to learning all of the things the world of JavaScript had to offer me. I also wanted to enjoy the last couple weeks here in this environment as much as I could because a hardworking community like the one in Turing will be very hard to come by again.

### Feedback to Me

*  __ Sunny:__ Working with Alex on gametime was the best paired experience I've had at Turing. I'm continually blown away at his discipline and work ethic. Any differences or disagreements we had with code, rare as they were, were handled so well that they always lead to a better feature. More than anything it was also just an enjoyable experience. Pairing can be tough at times, but this felt more like a celebration of code. I think at times he can get stuck on a certain idea or way of thinking about a problem, but once a solution was found he would stay curious and want to understand how it worked in order to improve. Keep that up! I look forward to working with you again sometime!

* __ Marina Corona: __ I’m constantly impressed by the hard work and dedication that Alex puts into his projects and his learning.  It was once joked that Alex stayed on campus longer than anyone else, but no one can deny his commitment to taking time to learn and learn well.  This can be seen in his strong projects, from his Gametime project to his Trelora project.  I also appreciate Alex’s genuine curiosity and want to inquire and clarify in class. I think his commitment to learning and asking questions will be huge assets for him in the future.  I am excited to see where Alex goes on this journey as a developer and know he will do very well.

* __ Jon Liss: __ Although I haven't had any projects with you, the times I have paired with you in class or otherwise have made me regret that.  You bring a real perspective to your work, and incorporate your experiences growing up into everything you do.  You may not feel this way, but I'm really happy you jumped down into our cohort for mod 3 and 4 haha.  #BeLikeKris and you'll go places bro!  I'll catch you and Sunny in the future and we'll play some basketball eventually.

* __ Kris Foss: __ I was so excited to have Alex in our cohort.  He was incredibly welcoming to me when I first started and I was really looking forward to coding with him.  I had seen what he was doing with some pretty advanced google permissions and I was impressed.  Alex is incredibly dedicated and mature, I often completely forget he’s so much younger than I am because he does not present that way.  He has the real world experience and the focus to know how to apply himself, 100%.  He’s a very talented programmer who can meet challenges head on and excel.  In addition to his technical chops, he’s also a genuine, solid person who really comes through, which has meant a lot.   I am proud to be friends with Alex.  He’s someone I would actively seek out to have on my team and in my corner.  He stepped up when I was pretty lost on some concepts and gave his time, patiently explaining in a way that made sense.  He really understands the code and the different languages that have been thrown at us.  I know how passionate he is about important issues in the community and I know he will do big things and have real impact.  Much love for you Alex, can’t wait to see what you do!
ps thanks for the feedback : )!!!

### Giving Feedback
*  __ Sunny:__ I've known Sunny since November and it has been very cool seeing how much he has improved as a software developer. In GameTime, we finally had the opportunity to pair together for the first time on a school project and I knew that it was going to be great. Sunny has the most amazing enthusiastic attitude when it comes to programming that I truly admire because it made the pairing experience amazing. I remember the day before GameTime was due we were done with basic functionality earlier than most people but continued coding until 4 AM since believed in each other's skills to really give it our 100%. Also, what I really like about Sunny is how he is able to figure out hard problems and stay calm/focused until he figures it out no matter how long it takes him. That in itself shows who he truly is, a person who never gives up no matter how hard the problem is. Thanks for being the most dopest partner anyone could've asked for and for being a good friend during my time in Turing.

*  __ Marina Corona:__ So there's this girl I know named Marina, lets leave it at that... Sike! Marina has been one of the closest people I've always kept in touch with throughout my time in Turing. What I enjoy about her is the fact how she didn't give up on herself even when she was constantly pondering whether or not she wanted to continue being in this stressful environment. This shows a lot about her, it shows that she is aware that things just don't come without putting in the work. Of course how can I forget to mention her professional side! I'm not too sure if people know this but Marina's professional side is something NOBODY else in Turing can match! Marina has that on lock where she knows exactly how to network and get in contact with people who she believes can give her a boost into getting the job she wants. I have no doubt in both her technical and professional skills that she will get the job she wants in the future. Thanks for being a good friend and also PROPS ON BEING LATINA SOFTWARE ENGINEER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -- ALEX

*  __ Jon Liss:__ We never paired nor got a chance to play basketball with Sunny so there's that but you're a really good friend man. I really enjoyed the conversations we had ever since I joined the 1602 cohort (the one nobody understands unless you're part of it). In a way, I'm glad that I had the chance to really get to know you since we both made similar life decisions in deciding to drop out from college and go into a school like Turing. I hope we can keep in touch in the future since I'm curious where you'll be at in life in the next three years. #BeLikeKris -- ALEX

*  __ Kris Foss:__ I remember the first time I met you when we had lunch roulette together at "Protein Bar" and you began to talk about your background. From what I can remember about the conversation it seemed like you were in a really stressful state which always made me wonder how the hell you were even pushing forward with that and being a student at Turing. This really showed a lot about you where I was left with the impression that you truly are one of the most hardest working students I've met in Turing. I'm glad I was able to get to know you better when I joined 1602 because I got to see another side of you. I got to see a happier Kris who wasn't so serious or taking the most amazing notes ever! I got to see a Kris that taught me a very important skill (basic floral design) that will help in the the future when I have to plan a last minute gift for my significant other. I got to see a Kris who just looked at a much calmer place than the one I met at "Protein Bar". Thanks for being a good friend and without a doubt I know you will have a job as a dev and be making that money that'll allow you to travel the world again and get to show off your marital art skills! #BeLikeKris

### Playing a Part
* Would have strong communication between Andy and Kristen who are in the front-end program and was there for them whenever they had any questions about programming or the Turing environment

* Attended my first Denver.rb meetup supporting Ashwin in his talk!

* Would let my true opinions come out during Gear Up even when in the back of my mind I wouldn't want to speak up at times


### Reflections on Turing
Turing is by far one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. In fact, it was the perfect thing I could've done education-wise to really push myself to do extreme challenges others would've easily ignored. I still remember when I was in 1510 and realized that not only did I have to somehow adapt to a culture that was not at all similar to mines but I also had to learn something I've never done before in a short amount of time. I know there were people within the student body who didn't believe I was going to make it but guess what? I did. If anything, Turing was my way of proving to the world that I can do anything in this life as long as I put my mind to it.

### The Future of Alex Navarrete

Besides doing the basic stuff that is expected of me, (such as getting a job as a software engineer) I envision my future to go far beyond just that. Ever since I was living in East LA I knew deep down I was meant to do something big in this life that will make a positive impact to people around the world. Now, I don't know what that is just yet but I feel like I'm getting really close to finding out. Without a doubt, one of the goals I do have in mind is to have my own start-up by 23 that will be in my hometown (Huntington Park) just so it can motivate others within my community to get into the tech game. I have a feeling that due to how "different" I am I will be a controversial figure within the tech industry so let's see which side y'all would be in by then!
