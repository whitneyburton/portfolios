# Kami Boers - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with very little coding experience, so my major goal for this module was to learn as much as possible about the process and theory of coding. In doing so, I hoped to develop confidence as a coder and to develop as a person within this community, collaborating effectively with my fellow students and instructors. I have found myself in situations that would normally have been far outside of my comfort zone, and I feel confident that I'm growing both as a programmer and a person. Looking back to the beginning of the module, I'm proud of how far I have come, and my hope for the coming modules is that I'm able to contribute to others as much as Turing students have already contributed to me.

 
##Midterm Assessment

Assessed by Horace:

Notes:

* Baseline profiency is in a pretty good spot
* Areas to focus on are the "prep" phase -- i.e. writing pseudocode, writing tests, outlining
the specific problem we're trying to solve
* And then being more disciplined and focused on implementing only what is needed to achieve these
goals
* Also want to see more diverse use of various enumerable methods by the end of the module

##### Evaluation

##### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

##### 2. Ruby Style
* 2: Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity

##### 3. Blocks & Enumerations
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

##### 4. Testing
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

##### 5. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

##### 6. Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before*​ attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Work

During this module, I chose to move to Echo, in large part because I learn better when I am challenged, and I absolutely was challenged by the projects that we were given. I found myself having to work exceptionally hard to keep up with the pace of the group. I wasn't always able to complete the requirements of each project, but I think that the quality of my work, the clarity of my code, and in particular my effective development of testing grew by leaps and bounds with each project. 

### Individual Projects

#### Mastermind

Mastermind is a command line version of the classic guessing game. This project was my first time coding a project of any complexity. 

* [Github link.] (https://github.com/kamiboers/mastermind)
* [Project spec here.] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* Difficulty levels
* Logic in program is separated into methods very well, jsut needs to take
additional step and pull associated methods out together into modules or classes.
* REPL was pleasant to use. Difficulty levels extensions.
* Very strong effort for first project.

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

##### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.


####Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree required me to build a searchable data structure. This was probably my weakest project, as I ran out of time and wasn't able to fulfil the main requirements of the project spec. But, I learned an incredible amount about coding data structures and was proud of the functionality of what I was able to accomplish.

Assessed By: Tess

Notes: Ran out of time on 3 of the methods for the base expectations and didn't test.

##### 1. Functional Expectations
1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### 2. Test-Driven Development
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


##Sorting Suite

Sorting Suite required us to develop a set of sorting methods of increasing complexity, in order to learn about the efficiency of each and to develop greater familiarity with recursion. This project represented a big step up for me in terms of performance, and I felt that I gained a great deal from the experience.

* [Github URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/projects/tree/master/sorting_suite)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Assessed By: Nate

##### Functional Expectations
3: All three sort classes work as expected

##### Testing
3: Tests cover functionality and demonstrate some escalation of complexity across the examples.

##### Ruby Style
2: Code runs effectively but has large issues with readability (long methods, confusing method or variable names, etc)

##### Organization
3: Each sorter class has it's own file in the proper directory and it's own test in the test directory


## Battleship 

Battleship is a command line battleship game project with a particular emphasis on TDD. In Battleship, I found myself once again struggling with time. I was able to code effectively, but was unable to move the project forward because of challenges with testing. The feedback for my code was positive, and following this project I sought out help with TDD from multiple different sources.

* [Github URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/projects/tree/master/battleship)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

Assessed by: Nate

Notes:
* TDD is holding you back. Find your entry point to TDD. Use the things you're good at to help you.

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 3. Test-Driven Development
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

##### 4. REPL Interface
1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

##### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


## HTTPYYKM

Though HTTP was a paired project, the module was at an odd number of people and I volunteered to work alone. I was somewhat overwhelmed by the amount of independent research that was required before I even managed to get started. But, I think that this was the project where I learned and grew the most. I came up just short of truly solid scores on my assessment but, in part as a result of this experience, I now have the tools to make this and future projects a real success.

* [Github URL](https://github.com/kamiboers/httpyykm)
* [Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Assessed By: Horace

## Notes

* Lot of progress on decomposing methods and objects after our initial checkin the day before
* Looks like we are starting to put the pieces together around building method interfaces out of simple values and using this to make testing easier
* Testing is also getting better but still needs more volume; we're testing the basic cases for each one but just need more; however now that we have the interfaces built to be more malleable this will actually be possible
* Works well for I0-I3; few hiccups here and there, but mostly pretty smooth; didn't quite get into I4
* Next steps on organization would be looking at the Server class and pulling more and more of its bits into other objects
* Always want to look for what is the connection to the outside world and make that as small as possible

#### Evaluation:

##### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2+: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


## Team Projects

Black Thursday is a data analysis engine that parses and interrelates subsets of data in order to return analysis of a complex system. This was my first and only paired project of the module.

### Feedback I've Given

* to Marina Corona: Marina is an excellent partner for paired projects. Her planning, attention to detail and commitment to logical and well-tested development of code have helped to ensure that our project develops intentionally and effectively. Without her skills for visualization and TDD, I would have struggled to move forward in an intelligent way. Marina's flexibility and willingness to learn as well as teach have helped me to understand coding in a new way, and I'm very grateful for the opportunity to work with her. As a natural and experienced teacher, I look forward to seeing the great things that Marina will bring to fellow students as a member of Turing. 

* to Matt Pindell: I really enjoyed working with Matt on the Robot tests. Matt is super knowledgable and is excellent at facilitating understanding for his partner without coding for them. His approach helped me to slow me down and pay attention to my actions rather than rushing ahead and causing additional errors. I feel that I have a more thorough understanding of testing that will come in handy for future projects. Matt is a natural, positive teacher and could easily develop that skill to benefit himself and the Turing community.

* to Sal Espinosa: Sal is quickly becoming one of the best people that I know. His poise and his kindness to other people are something that we can all aspire to. I see him as one of those people that plugs away with quiet brilliance, always willing to help others, whether by answering questions or supporting them through their day. I think that Sal can bring a lot to Turing, and I look forward to seeing him step up as a leader over the coming months.

### Feedback to Me

* from Marina Corona: Kami is a very strong problem solver. She has been great to work with for Black Thursday. I feel like I'm learning more about how classes call on each other through her explanations and understanding.  I also am very grateful to have her as a partner because she is very reliable and communicative. As a student advisory board member, her notes and presentations are very thorough.  I think Kami is a strong leader and think she will be such an asset to module 2.

* from Matt Pindell: Kami knows what she's doing - she only needs to vocalize her thought process and not apologize for where her gut takes her. I could have definitely done a better job at giving hints of where to go (and been less cryptic in general), but Kami's logic was 100% sound. Once she can clearly and confidently break down her reactions to hiccups / bumps in the code, she'll be crushing it 24/7.

* from Sal Espinosa: Kami is one of the people in my cohort that I’ve connected with the most. My experience with her has been very much on the personal, let’s-keep-each-other-sane level, and for that she’s been immensely helpful. On the other hand, I’ve also had the pleasure of seeing her lead group retros, and been in the room with her prepping to lead a Gear-Up. It’s been a funny surprise to me to see her take on those leadership roles, because I’m not sure it’s her favorite thing to do. She’s clearly got the aptitude for it, but I’d guess that she feels some sense of responsibility, which is nice since we all reap the rewards. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with Kami.

### Playing a Part

The sudden shift to the schedule and intensity of student life at Turing left me feeling not as involved as I hoped to be in student activities. However, I made an effort to be involved in posse challenges, participated in Gear Up as a facilitator and was a member of the Student Advisory Board, attending weekly meetings and presenting during 1602's Group Retro meetings during Module 1. I feel like I have really stepped out of my comfort zone and the rewards have been incredible. I'm happy to be a part of Turing and I hope to give back as much as possible to my fellow students and members of my community over the remainder of Turing and beyond.
