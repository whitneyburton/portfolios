# Christine Gamble - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
Just a couple of months before I came to Turing I graduated from DU with a Masters in International Development. I decided to come to Turing because I think coding has so many applications and I think it matches my skills and interests. I would love to find a way to connect what I learn from Turing with my passion for poverty alleviation.

I am coming in to Turing with practically no coding experience.  During this module I hope to develop a solid foundation of the basics of coding, which I can continue to build upon during my time here and beyond.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Mid-Module Assessment
Assessed By: Jorge Téllez

##### Notes:
Good collaboration skills. Feels comfortable with the tools. Needs more practice with the syntax. Sometimes she knew what she wanted but had difficulty translating those ideas into code. I think she just needs to do solve more problems. I recommended Exercism to her.

##### Scores:
- Ruby Syntax & API - 2
- Ruby Style- 3
- Blocks & Enumerations - 2
- Testing - 2
- Workflow - 4
- Collaboration - 4



### Work

This module consisted of two individual projects (Jungle Beats and Night Writer) and two partner projects (HTTP and Headcount).

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/JungleBeats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

* [Readme](https://github.com/ccgamble/JungleBeats/blob/master/readme.md)

(This project uses linked lists to make a drum machine. The learning goals are to practice breaking a program into logical components, distinguish between classes and instances of those classes, understand how linked lists work to store and find data, and test components in isolation and in combination.)

Assessed by Nate:
-	Don't be afraid to use your own methods in your tests, as long as you have tested them.
-	Break up your methods more. When you can, pull code out into it's own well named method.
-	The return word is not usually necessary, and in ruby, is considered not best practices.

Scores:
-	Functional Expectations – 2
-	TDD – 3
-	Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components – 3
-	Fundamental Ruby & Style – 2
-	Looping or Recursion - 4

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ccgamble/Night_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

(This project implements systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse. The learning goals are to practice breaking a program into logical components, test components in isolation and in combination, apply enumerable techniques in a real context, and read text from and writing text to files.)

Assessed by Horace:
-	Overall process is pretty clear -- the high level structure of the code follows the shape of the problem pretty clearly
-	Consistent use of methods that take in values and return values makes things easy to read even when some of the methods are a little long
-	Enums are ok in some spots but inconsistent and especially have a lot of cases where we could apply a Map instead of an each
-	Other big area to focus on is testing -- basically just don't enough of it here
-	I think some things about how you're setting up the code would actual lend themselves well to testing the methods, so we just need to do that
-	Still see some longer methods that could use a little more deconstruction and I think the testing would actually help with this process


Scores:
-	Overall Functionality – 3
-	Fundamental Ruby & Style- 3
-	TDD – 1
-	Breaking Logic into Components – 3


## Team

### Projects

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/alireza/http-part2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

(This project introduces HTTP and builds a functioning web server.  The learning goals are to practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components, practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels, understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works, and practice implementing basic HTTP request and responses.)

* [DTR Memo](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/http-you-know-me-2/blob/master/dtr.md)

Assessed by Mike:
-	application works, through iteration five.
-	37 tests
-	Some really long methods, can pull out a lot of code to shorten up methods
-	examples of this include conditional branches
-	pull conditions out to methods returning booleans to increase readability
-	Some repetition of code.


Scores:
-	Functional Expectations – 3
-	TDD – 4
-	Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components – 3
-	Fundamental Ruby & Style – 3
-	Enumerable & Collections - 3


#### Headcount (Final Project)



* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/headcount.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

(This project takes a large collection of education data from the government and analyzes it and builds connections so that questions can be answered.  The learning goals are to use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code, decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools, use fixture instead of actual data when testing, connect related objects together through references, and learn an agile approach to building software.)


Assessed by: Horace
* Functional through I5 -- hits requirements there
* 80% doing great with method size / complexity, then have a handful scattered around that are getting larger
* Mostly using enums to proper effect -- looked at a few spots where we're using map but not actually mapping or using each to iteratively modify some values
* Testing is quite strong -- one of the stronger points of the project; mostly because we're both doing small isolated unit tests with hand-rolled data on our low-level methods AND doing the high-level integration stuff by passing in the whole pile of CSV files
* Looked at method interface constraints -- often in this project the spec forces you to define methods in certain ways, but we can still manage that complexity internally by having that method actually delegate out to other methods that implement the various cases
​

Scores:
-	Functional Expectations – 3
-	TDD – 4
-	Encapsulation/ Breaking Logic into Components – 3
-	Fundamental Ruby & Style – 3
-	Enumerable & Collections - 3
- Code Sanitation - 4

#### Posse Challenges
  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kay-posse)- The posse challenges can be found here.

Being a part of the Kay-posse has been a great experience.  I have made sure to regularly attend all of the meetings and contribute when I can.  I really appreciate that everyone in this group is committed to showing up and participating.  The first week of the module we all went out for drinks, and that was a great time to bond as a group and get to know everyone. I appreciate that we work as a team to solve the challenges, we each take turns driving, and they have been there to give me advice on other projects.

### Giving Feedback

(To Ali Anderson) Ali was a great person to pair with for my first partner project.  We worked together on http-yeah-you-know-me.  He is incredibly driven and will do whatever it takes to get the project done.  I thought we communicated openly from the very beginning, and this allowed us to be successful with the project.  Ali thinks very logically and was able to envision a clear setup for all of the different classes and how they should work together. During the project there were a couple of times when we made problems more complicated then they had to be, and this caused us to lose time. If we had taken a step back from the problem and looked at the bigger picture we might have saved some time. Overall though, Ali’s logical thinking and determination will ensure success in the future.

(To Matt DesMarteau) I had the opportunity to pair with Matt several times in class and on Headcount, which was my second paired project. He was a great person to work with because he thinks in a very logical way and he is even better at explaining things, from his thought process to a new method.  I appreciated his willingness to talk through these things, and it made collaborating easy.  I know I am not the only one in the class who has benefited from Matt's approach to learning and teaching others.  Matt's work ethic and focus allowed him to move through the different challenges of this project, and I'm sure this will lead to continued success in the future.
### Being a Community Member

I had the opportunity to pair with Christine for http-yeah-you-know-me. As this being my third pair project, I wasn’t as nervous as I was the last time around. Christine took all the nervousness that I had a way. She is extremely passionate about learning code and it shows with her logic solving. She understands that programming does not have a specific one way of doing things. This was super valuable during our pairing project and allowed us to approach problems in different ways.   I know she will end up being a great programmer and I look forward to her success!  (Ali Anderson)

Sorry I didn't get to this earlier. I know it's been a while now and I don't remember this instance of working together exactly.
However, I think we have worked together a couple of times and I think that overall you're a good partner. You listen well and are interested in doing good work.
I think one thing I would have appreciated is a little more thinking out loud from you. It's hard to know what to do with silence - if it means you are thinking or bored or not following or if I'm doing something wrong and you're afraid of saying something. So maybe just being more aware about thinking out loud more would help your partners know how to work with you better. (Ashwin Rao)

I had the opportunity to pair with Christine in class as well as with our final project Headcount.  I enjoyed collaborating with Christine because she is a very intelligent person who stays focused on the task at hand where ever the code may take us.  There are many different ways to solve a problem and I hold a lot of respect for Christine’s responsiveness to different attempts and tactics as we moved through solving problems together.  While team pairing on the same computer screen, she is always right there and focused on the next line of code and stays determined to figure out the answers even when solutions seem distant.  We both could benefit from more practice with tough programming functionality, but her focus and ability to ask the right questions at the right time when tackling a tough problem helped the group to step back and take different approaches or think about the problem in a different way.  I think she will be a great programmer if she sticks with it. (Matt DesMarteau)

### Playing a Part
- I have attended all of the Joan Clarke Society meetings this module and plan to continue attending this meetings.

- I am a part of LGBTuring and plan to go to future events. I appreciate that this group exists.

- I recently started going to the Code for Denver meetups. They work with local non-profits and the government and develop projects to serve the community's needs.  New projects are being proposed next week, so I am hoping to get connected with one after that. I am really excited about continuing my involvement with this because it really connects what I am learning with coding with what I was doing before and my passion for poverty alleviation.
