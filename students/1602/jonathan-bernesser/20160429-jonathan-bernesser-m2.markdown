### Feedback to Me - Self-Solicited

* Feedback from **Matt Pindell/Rails Mini Peer Eval**:
"Jon impressed me with the breadth of optional extensions that wove into his Rails Mini Project. Despite the limitations of one weekend, he went above and beyond the base requirements and took the project as an opportunity to learn as much as he could about new tools - much as he does with his side projects - and had a bevy of knowledge to share about the pros and cons, particularly with design features.”

* Feedback from **Marina Corona/Little Shop**:
"Jon is a very strong teammate. From the beginning he knew he wanted to work on the front end and took charge.  His quality of product is obvious in the output of this project and I'm very happy to have had him on the team.  Besides this I also loved being able to laugh with him and have a good time.  One thing that Jon could work on is being more flexible with design ideas and allowing others' opinions. For example, I really wanted Comic Sans as the font and that never happened."

& Feed from **Kami Boers/Rush Hour**:
"Jon was an absolutely bulletproof teammate on our Rush Hour project. He’s well known for his technical abilities in our cohort, and I got to see his skill firsthand.  Jon was able to keep us moving forward any time that we hit the slightest snag.

I was hugely impressed by Jon’s coding, but I enjoyed his sense of humor more. Even when group members disagreed about how to solve a certain problem, Jon’s good humor and openness kept any difference of opinion from feeling like a disagreement or creating strife in our group.

Jon's balance of raw technical ability with a cool, friendly demeanor will make him invaluable in any team environment. Rush Hour was the smoothest and most enjoyable project that I’ve worked on at Turing as a result and I’d be overjoyed to partner with him in the future."


## Community

### Giving Feedback
  Feedback to **Matt Pindell/Rails Mini Peer Review**:
“Matt brought a curious and excitable attitude to our peer refactor of the rails mini project. He was eager to learn how I implemented the api as well as Haml and provided great feedback in how I may be able to re-locate that logic outside of the controller. I had a great time walking through my project with him.  Through our pairing I  took with me some awesome suggestions into little shop. Overall I was throughly impressed with his drive to learn, perfectly exemplified by his willingness to hand-roll css."

* Feedback to **Marina Corona/Little Shop**:
  "Marina was a great team member. As the project manager for little shop, she was able to organize our separate strengths and weaknesses and come up with a plan that allowed us to have a successful project experience. I was impressed by her detailed oriented nature that allowed for a great git workflow. As a coder,  her determination is envious and it's  shown through her skill to execute features, especially tests. Overall, she is an asset to the turing community. One thing I would say to improve upon is to be more assertive to take first steps  in executing these features, as we all know you have the skill to!  Don’t be afraid to try new things without confirmation from the group!"

* Feedback to **Kami Boers/Rush Hour**:
  "Kami was a joy to work with in rush-hour. Not only is she a skilled coder but her calming presence was invaluable for thom’s and  I often fervent discussions! She was able consistently resolve issues and bring the group together toward our common goal. This allowed us to create a project that I think we were all proud of. Without her, I don’t think we would have had nearly as a successful project. I hope we work together again soon!""

### Playing a Part

* Started a Hack-A-Thon Team - Elm Tic-Tac-Toe - Presented at the showcase
* Organized and executed a student let elective - "Having Fun with Elm Lang"
* Attended all posse meet-ups

### Posse - Golick

Although we haven't had much to show from it, I have found this modules posse experience to be wonderful.
Between learning a bit more server ops, curl requests and seeing how Alan implemented a client to control a drone, my experience here has made me much ore interested in software engineer as a whole.

It been really nice to have a core group of friends that were able to share their passions with each other.
I have been motivated to see how talented other students are. Without the pervasive passion for programming that was demonstrated by everyone in my posse, I don't think I would have been nearly successfully in taking risks in my projects or been comfortable enough to learn a new language.

For next, I would love to have a more concrete structure, but overall, my experience was very much a positive on.
