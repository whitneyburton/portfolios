# Thom Pickett - M4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

I still wasn't sure going into mod4 what I wanted to do when I got out of Turing. Like most of my time at Turing I just went through working on whatever was suggested and taking an interest in whatever came up. I ended up doing WebGL by stumbling around trying to find my interests and it was amazing. 

### End of Module Assessment 

Notes

- refactor some js stuff. It looks great. closure
- write tests!

### Giving Feedback

Ashwin:  
Ashwin was amazing at figuring out the big picture. He was very inventive and came up with great solutions. When we realized we couldn't use standard collision detection, Ashwin came up with an elegant solution for customizable shapes in collision detection. Ashwin was also great to pair with. He'd continuosly ask questions that moved the project forward, and both invited and challenged new ideas and solutions. This lead to a very creative atmoshphere.

Chad:  
Chad kept a steady positive energy on a project that was stressful and difficult all the way through. On one of our previous projects he forced us, and this was a good thing, to take pomodoroes consistently through out the project. Even through the highs and lows and times when the atmosphere was tense, Chad was amazing at keeping communication open. He asked questions when he needed clarify things and took the time to explain his thought process. Chad had great ideas and would benefit from pushing through the struggles to solutions, before turning to others. He is an extremely dedicated programmer. The last night of our Trelora project, we were not happy with where it was. We had implemented base functionality several days before, and even built most of the extras that our clients had asked for, but we were both unhappy with it still, and so Chad suggested an all nighter. Chad kept the energy going and the project moving forward. Chad kept the standards up throughout the project, even when we felt pressed for time. He questioned everything he noticed that he thought could be refactored or completely redesigned. He is very thoughtful about everything he does.

### Recieving Feedback

Chad:  
It was great to pair with Thom over the last couple of months and get to know him. Thom has a deep understanding of his code and is able to implement solutions very fast. His ability to hold complex and abstract blocks of information in his mind is one of his strengths. Another one of his strengths is his persistence. I've observed Thom power through difficult problems and implement solutions to problems with little background information or context. Most of all, I have enjoyed getting to know Thom and have no doubt that he will add a lot of value to the company he ends up working for.

Ashwin:  
It was great working with you. I think we achieved a lot of the goals we set for ourselves - to push ourselves to write good and to not hate each other at the end. I appreciated your dedication to do things the right way, whether that was in refactoring or not being satisfied with good-enough collision detection.  
I have a lot of respect for your determination to solve tough problems, too. I was impressed with how you figured out the refactoring of the planes class and solved that bug the night before the project was due that kept the game from being able to start over again.
I appreciated the times when we were pairing but you knew that you needed a few minutes to mess with the code yourself, and told me that's what you needed. I would encourage you to continue trying to build your awareness of when you are doing that so that your partner doesn't find himself sitting there watching you play with the code. But like I said, most of the time you did tell me that's what was going on, and that's all I really needed.
Overall, a great experience. Now that I'm a bit more removed from the project, I'm satisfied with what we built. And might actually be happy with it once we get those SVGs in place :)

### Playing a Part

I continued to be a part of Pahlka Posse as a member rather than as a leader this module since it was kindo of tradition. Kerry, Sonia, and Tomasina led it and it was in very capable hands. It's fun to see something that was just an idea that started when I was in mod2 becoming larger and larger over time. At first I thought the app Pahlka was making was just a good exercise, but the farther it goes the more I think it could be more. 

In addition to Pahlka I spent some time pairing with mod1 students.
