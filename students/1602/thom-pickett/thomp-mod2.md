# Thom Pickett - Module 1 Portfolio

## Assessments

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Andrew
#### Scores
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
###### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
###### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring
###### 3. Rails Syntax & API
* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support
###### 4. MVC & Rails Style
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
###### 5. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance
###### 6. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### My Notes from the Final Assessment
- Work on thorough testing
  - I set the tests up the right way, but didn't follow the storyline strictly until prompted
- Ruby inline variables could have been extracted to another method

### Mid Module Assessment

#### Scores
Evaluator: Andrew
Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:
###### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way
###### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
###### 3. Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance
###### 4. Rails Style
* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
###### 5. Testing
* 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
###### 6. Collaboration
* 4: Developer *actively seeks* collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### My Notes from the Mid Module Assessment
rails syntax work on forms syntax
rails style- pushing logic to where it belongs, put things where they belong right away
testing- make sure to lead with it, used them correctly, but after I had written the code.
collaboration- was over talking/collaborating which was good

##### My Notes from the Rush-Hour Assessment

tests
-more clarity on tests
-have the data accessible on the model level, don’t extract it to the test helper. Don’t have phantom data
-streamline tests for speed don’t do processes you don’t need
-don’t do unnecessary steps, don’t create items you don’t need
-structure your tests in an order that makes sense even though they’re not dependent.
-if you set up test data use it
-in css styling stick with one type of class names either snake case, or dashes or camelcase
-controller test don’t care about the model style tests, doesn’t care about what things return
-don’t need duplicate tests
controllers
make sure all navigation is available by clicking/ no typing into url
remember table can get data through another table they have in common
make sure classes only do what they imply
partials
add a conversation to github through comments to changed files.

#### Super-Coders

##### Scores
Assessed by: Andrew

For the evaluation we'll work through the expectations above and look at the
following criteria:

###### 1. Feature Completeness
* 4: All features are correctly implemented along with two extensions
###### 2. Views
* 4: Views show logical refactoring into layout(s), partials and helpers, with no logic present
###### 3. Controllers
* 4: Controllers show significant effort to push logic down the stack
###### 4. Models
* 4: Models show excellent organization, refactoring, and appropriate use of Rails features
###### 5. Testing
* 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels
###### 6. Usability
* 3.5: Project is highly usable and ready to deploy to customers
* 3.5: Project is highly usable, but needs more polish before it'd be customer-ready
###### 7. Workflow
* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.

##### My Notes from the Super-Coders Assessment

final project assessment from andrew
-add links to github
-rethink our create button, needs to be bigger, maybe needs moved
-make all contracts for admin more clear on what the page is, give it more detail
-make sure any functionality can be accessed by navigation, not by address bar
-make the pictures links

use helper method image_tag instead of img src=“”
pull out if else statements out of views
be careful of having active record of Category.all run before every action.
Stub in, take out the expense of logging in if you don’t need it
-if using rspec, use context and all the tools it gives

### Feedback To Me
Thom I’m quite astounded and surprised at how much you’ve grown as a programmer since module 1, and our HTTP-YYKM project.  You definitely dove deep and all in to learn this stuff, and it showed during the Little Shop. Glad to see you taking on side challenges as well with your mentor.  Sorry you fell ill (probably b/c of me - but hopefully not) during the project, but thanks for your willingness to do some work once you started to feel better.  I know this last week was tough on you physically, but I think you handled it well.  I’m looking forward to see your excitement for programming to grow even more on mod 3.  I think it’ll be exciting. - Hedy

Thom has been an absolute delight to work with in Pahlka posse. As one of the more senior students in our group, he was worked with new students to include them in our work and help them bridge gaps between the content they've learned and the work we're doing. His attitude and demeanor in meetings is casual and engaged -- a perfect mix that makes him easy to spend time with and work with. I've also had a chance to work with Thom in environment variables, and appreciate that he so readily voices ideas and feedback to ideas we're discussing. Because he is judicious about when he talks and what he says, he commands a good deal of respect from his peers. - Beth Sebian

Working with Thom on Rush Hour was one of the most enjoyable project experiences that I’ve had at Turing. Tom brought great ideas to the table, and his skill with Ruby and ActiveRecord really shone. He helped to foster an environment where everyone felt comfortable disagreeing, and where a little back-and-forth about the direction that the project was taking was constructive and even enjoyable. I’d be happy to work with him in the future. - Kami

### Feedback From Me

Hedy, I was really glad we worked together on this project. You’re very passionate, and driven to get the most out of everything you work on. You definitely pushed us to make the best app we could have. I was impressed with your ability to both figure out what you needed to implement features you wanted, and look up the sources on how to do them, and that you never seem to be daunted by what you have to do.

Kami It was great working with you on Rush-Hour. You were very focused, and great at focusing on the the issues that actually needed done. You also did a good job of communicating what you needed to be most productive, and to make it through the project.
### Playing a Part

I set up a pairing schedule for 1602 and 1603, and then signed up to pair on it for all 6 weeks. I was part of Pahlka posse, which was one of the biggest successes I've seen at Turing so far. We were all extremely motivated and also worked great as a team together. We built an App to find neighborhoods based upon criteria entered. I plan on staying in it through at least next mod.
It was great in that it we went through the whole experience as a team of finding what everyone was passionate about, deciding how we could implement that into something useful for an under-represented market, and then building the whole app from scratch.
