# Jeneve Parrish - M2 Portfolio


## Areas of Emphasis

In my second module at Turing, I have made it a priority to improve my workflow,
typing, navigation and general efficiency as that was a big struggle for me in the first Module.
This effort has paid off in a big way as speeding up my process allows me to write more code, try more things in debugging. And to quickly follow a fleeting notion before it disappears. The process of coding feels more natural and comfortable now. I also entered the Module with a lot of confusion and
trepidation about git workflow- so much so, that I would avoid working when I knew it would result in
merge conflicts. I am now comfortable with the basic git workflow in a small-team project.


### End of Module Assessment

## Peer Evaluated Projects
### Idea Group (Rails Mini Project)

Idea Group is a fun, friendly social app for sharing ideas. When a user posts an
idea, an image is automatically generated to support that idea. Admin users can create categories for default users to categorize their ideas, and can delete any idea that they find offensive. All users, including guests, can browse ideas by category or by author, or see a collection of everyones ideas together on the index page.

**Peer Evalutator Comments**:

 * Jeneve, I was glad to pair with you for your mini-rails. You definitely got style, and it was probably the nicest looking site among the show and tells.

## Group Projects
### Rush Hour

Rush Hour is an application that parses and stores data submitted by commercial website clients each time one of their pages is requested. Clients can then visit Rush Hour to view a breakdown of how, when and why their site is being accessed, along with how long responses take.

**Team**: Sal Espinosa & Jeneve Parrish & Gurusundesh Khalsa & Alireza Andersen

**Evaluator**: Rachel


 * [Github repository](https://github.com/GKhalsa/rush_hour)
 * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)
 * [Evaluation scores](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1602/rush_hour.md#evaluation-rubric-2)

**Notes**:

* all base functionality exists; iteration 8 needs to be scoped to the client
* use of "builder" objects for data presentation
* good use of Active Record for querying
* very clean views
* send only one object into a view
* needed to test that one couldn't post without a client
* needed to create a #no_payloads? method.
* try not to update, as it's confusing.
* needs more testing for scope.

### Little Shop

Our Little Shop, titled Eccentric Travel, is a booking site for travel to other planets. Users can choose package trips to planets throughout the solar system and beyond. Checkout by credit card is enabled! Admin users can create new packages and view all past bookings.

**Team**: Marina Corona & Jon Bernesser

**Evaluator**: Rachel

 * [Evaluation scores](https://gist.github.com/jeneve/a88cedad0800188382ae340f82c4ca8f)

**Notes**:

 * format the times presented in the views.
 * danger: people can create packages even if they aren't admins- utilize the namespace more.
 * create and use a #current_admin? method.
 * delete unused files in charges views.
 * make an OrderGenerator class. Right now, there will be an orphan order in the table if things go wrong.
 * make and use a method #dashboard_path.
 * store quantity and price on the order_packages table.

## Feedback

#### From peers

 - (from Sal) Jeneve! You were my rock in the Rush Hour project. I think you know, but just in case: I very often found myself looking to you to validate things I was saying, and to check the validity of approaches other teammates were proposing. You clearly communicated your time constraints, and then proceeded to outwork most of the group, popping back online in the evening after we had gone home for the day. You handled all the styling, and gave us a wonderful looking page (that I know never quite met your expectations, but seemed super awesome to me). In class I feel like you've been more outspoken this module, and it's been a pleasure to hear you ask the questions that I was about to ask (or thought about asking, but then kept my hand down for no good reason whatsoever). As we were working, I know that git was something that you wanted to work on, and the one recommendation I have would be to find something you can break so that you can learn how to bring something back from the brink.

 - (from Sunny) I got to work on a project with Jeneve after having never done so, nor really having gotten to know her. I missed out. She's dope. She's extremely passionate about programming and was incredibly dedicated. Sometimes I think that enthusiasm might have pushed her into some rabbit holes. But that is how you learn baby! ~

 - (from Ali) Working with you has been a remarkable experience and I hope to have the opportunity to pair with you on another project. I know from experience that it can’t be easy juggling a family and school. You are so skilled at what you do. Pairing with was amazing. Your logic and approach are so unique and great! You design and work flow are stellar and your patience with working with the 3 of us was impressive. Every time I think of TDD i think of you and how proud you would be of me implementing it as my first step. I know you will be super successful in your career and will make a everlasting impression in this field. I guess if I have to give you some constructive feed back it will be nothing at all! I think your a great programmer Jeneve!

#### To peers

 - (to Sal) Working with you on Rush Hour was a pleasure. You are flexible and patient- always an anchor in our group when stress was rising. You know A LOT; that is clear. But one of the best qualities you brought to the team was a seemingly inexhaustible spring of ideas and process to try even after we had reached beyond the extent of our knowledge.  Your contribution to the 1602 cohort is bigger than just what you do in your role on the student advisory board. In that role, you are clearly attuned to the concerns of the whole cohort- you always bring up the issues that are on my mind in retros and you are able to address those and other concerns with sensitivity and eloquence. You have a knack for putting people at ease while assuring them that their worries are valid and are being heard. My advice would be to keep the focus on improving your technical skills, your soft skills are all there; you're a natural.

 - (to Sunny) Working with Sunny on the project Rush Hour was a pleasure. He is positive and hard-working, a great team-player. Sunny clearly LOVES programming and it shows in his technical ability and inquisitiveness. Sunny NEEDS to know why a thing is happening or is the way it is, which makes him excellent and relentless at debugging. Sometimes this quality might be a liability when a problem is, in fact, solved, but nobody knows why- Sunny’s still working on it! Sunny is fun and caring and would be an asset to any team. I hope I get to work with him again!

 - (to John Liss) Working with Jon on our Rails Mini Project was so much fun. Jon is a highly capable programmer who is endlessly generous with his knowledge and time. Jon is very creative and was able to see all the potential that the simple project offered. He was full of great ideas but alway open to trying mine too. I have learned a lot from Jon throughout our time together at Turing, because he has true synthesis of many high-level concepts. He clearly came into the program with more prior knowledge than many of us, but there is nothing that can prepare one for the pressure of the program- still, I haven’t seen Jon lose his cool. My advice to Jon would be to take in as much as he can from lessons in soft skills; Jon is very personable and easy to work with , but I know he hasn’t yet experienced a job search and, as someone who HAS- I think that the program is offering a lot in that department.

## Community

During the second module, I have tried to give back to the community after a lot of struggle last module. I joined a posse with several module one students, and was enriched every time I was able to help one of them with a project. I have worked on the skills of close listening and engaging in discussion with my peers in the module and in other modules, and sharing my reflections on what has helped me to make it this far. I have never ceased to be amazed at the determination and passion of the students at Turing, who seem to go to any length to succeed. The first week of the module I delivered a lightning talk designed to help students improve the form of their writing. I am now working on a student-led-session for next module where I hope to connect the Principles of Design, a subject I taught in my previous life, to both front *and* back-end coding.

### Posse Update

This module I joined the Miyamoto Posse, which focuses on game development and helping each other with projects and homework. I chose this posse because I wanted to _build_ something, and the project Chelsea and Holly proposed sounded approachable and fun. The highlight of Miyamoto's first 6 weeks was the code-a-thon, when we worked together to create a ridiculous and fun text-based game that takes place in the Turing basement. The project really helped to define what the Posse is about and bonded us together, plus, I learned the basics of ascii art.
