# Jeneve Parrish - M4 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to learn everything I could about best practices in front-end development. I had by then come to realize that this is where both my talent and interests are centered. To that end I put off my job search in order to focus on what was offered, attending every class and working through every assignment given, even when I had all the points I needed. For the final Scale-up project I worked on the Front-End React app, and took on some issues specifically requiring learning some advanced CSS topics.

## ScaleUp - Looking For React Front End

**Summary of my work on the project**

I did research into animating with CSS, using the Sketch design app and SVG. I paired with my team to refactor the code in the project and fix some major bugs, and in so doing learned a lot about the structure and workings React components. I think we did work that will enormously help the next teams make real progress in adding new features and improving User Experience.

**(Feedback from Sal)**

It was great to work with you again. I think you have a better sense by now, but, just in case, every time I bring you up with the people who's opinions I value the response is the same: "Jeneve? She's a killer." I always have faith that when you set off on your own for the evening you're going to come back with finished work. It sounds like such a simple thing now that I put it down, but it matters. Again this time around you proved that when I'm stuck and we pair there's a good chance you'll find a way through the rubble. I was stuck on the issue of how to render that jobs component, couldn't find the answer in the research I'd done, and you cut through with a solution. I'd like to see you drive more! I feel like I could've done a better job of asking you to take over every now and again, but I hope in the future when confronted with someone hogging the keyboard that you'll elbow your way in. I suppose this isn't complete without me mentioning what a pleasure it was to have you as a personality on the team. It was certainly good to talk code, but also great to talk just Mod 4 and other nonsense. It's sad to me that I just realized how much I'm going to miss you, and can only hope that you're on to an awesome next step. Keep doing what you're doing.

**(Feedback from Marina)**

When I heard that Gametime was a self-selected partner project, I immediately thought of Jeneve. After working with her on our e-commerce site two modules earlier, I knew that working with her again would be a great experience. Jeneve has command of the JavaScript language, an eye for design and always finishes exactly what she says she will do. After four weeks of total pairing with her, I can honestly say that she has met every deadline set, is well organized and works tirelessly to perfect a project. She also is an excellent communicator. She discusses early on potential issues that will arise in a project, provides possible solutions and listens to others' ideas. Her analytical skills are also very strong as she can find bugs and debug quickly and efficiently. I would highly recommend Jeneve for any developer job as she is a quick learner and takes extra time to understand what she doesn't understand.

### Playing a Part

I prepared a student-led session for the first week of classes hoping to begin a conversation about how the Principles of Design can be applied to code, both on the front and back end of applications. I cancelled the session because only 2 people signed up, hoping to build some more interest and offer the session later. I regret that because the opportunity to offer the session again never arose; Mod 4 was pretty much booked every Friday from then on. On the upside of that, Participating in pairing sessions with Mod 1 on the Front-end was a highlight of the module for me.
