### Feedback for Others

  * Mark Miranda

    "After going through the Turing experience with Mark, I have no doubt that he will be an enormous asset to the next team that is lucky enough to have him. This is not only due to his programming abilities (which are undeniably strong) but also because of his above-and-beyond role in building the community - from stickers, to t-shirts, to just being a genuinely fun and positive force within the cohort - Mark fundamentally shaped the 1602 experience for the better."

### Feedback to Me

  * Sunny Khalsa

    "Just like how physicists talk about third and fourth dimension beings, sometimes I think Matt might actually just be a thesaurus. A goddamn beautiful thesaurus. Seriously though, Matt adds so much to everything; 1602, Turing, hanging out. He's a fucking solid coder and I'm super grateful to have gone through this experience with him."

  * Mark Miranda / Game Time

    "Matt carried our group from the start to the finish line of game time. I went on a family trip and was unable to work as much as I had initially hoped. Matt kept our group moving forward and would gladly surrender points to him if he was short points for passing. He was a great partner and always had a handle what we needed to focus on next. He's technically strong and a quick learner. I was fortunate to be paired with Matt."
