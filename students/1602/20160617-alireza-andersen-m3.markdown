### Areas of Emphasis

"He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life." *Muhammad Ali*

The goal of Module 3 was to increase my knowledge in Rails and Active Record. During the Module I have gained the knowledge needed to become a Junior Developer and am confident that my skills and knowledge of Rails will ensure my success in module4 as well as in my future career as a developer.

"There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning." *Jiddu Krishnamurti*

### End of Module Assessment
Evaluated by Nate Allen with the following results:
- Good use of strong params, but could use require(:item) to be more railsy
- Good use of APIController
- Good use of Serializer gem
- Good request specs. Could break item creating out into a support file
- Service is pretty well broken out, but could make better use of faraday, like params and do blocks
- BestBuySearch PORO is written really well, but named funky. Should be named for the resource type, like BestBuyStore
- Good use of VCR, but you committed your cassettes, which means you committed your API key

### Attendance

For module 3, I once again attended all days, every day, even the days that there were no school. I have never missed a day nor have I been late to class.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Adventure Time!!

* [Outdoor Adventure Time](https://outdooradventuretime.herokuapp.com/)
* [Colorado Adventure Github](https://github.com/alirezaandersen/adventure_time.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Project Description

Ever want to plan an outdoor adventure but not sure on traffic or how the weather is going to be? We now you know! Search for near by parks and see the current weather and 5 day forecast.

ADVENTURE TIME project has 2 CSV data for Colorado state zip code and National Forest Service National parks. Besides creating the two API's (feel free to gather info from the website) It also uses the following external API's to track your day and gather the information you want. OpenWeather, Underground Weather, Accu Weather, Google Places, Google Maps, Google Geocode, and Twitter. Have a sunny day!

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Project Description

The Rails Engine project takes in CSV data from the Black Thursday repo and creates a RESTful Rails API that includes record endpoints, relationship endpoints, and business intelligence endpoints.

Evaluated by Nate Allen with the following results:

* Think about what you're testing, what it's job is, and how to know it's doing it's job
* Logic in models should be tested with model tests instead of Features
* Remember there's a slight difference in how you define nested modules
* Strong params doesn't provide value in getters. They're for sanitizing data before going into the database
*  Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries

#### ApiCurious!

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

Project Description

Focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs.

As a vehicle for learning these concepts, I worked with several API from a popular websites (OpenWeather, UndergroundWeather, FaceBook) and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API.

As I built these features, I also worked with the OAuth protocol to authenticate my users with the third-party provider, and using various testing techniques to allow us to test against the third-party data.

## Team Project

#### Ziba Recruiting

I participated in the following team project:

* [Ziba Recruiting](http://ziba.herokuapp.com/)

In this 2 week project. Our team's purpose was to inherit a codebase from Module 2's final project [little_shop](https://github.com/pindell-matt/habitask.git) and expand on the project, including adding multi-tenancy and levels of authorization with a platform admin, multiple companies and administrative managers, and users. As well as a submissions to join our recruiting company.

### Posse

* I started of in the Resig Posse during Module 2 unfortunately our posse really didn't do anything at all throughout 2 and for module 3 decided to join ranks with another posse. I attended one meeting and it was clear that no lesson would happen so I decided to leave the posse. Super Sad.


### Feedback to Me

  I learned a lot of new things throughout this project mainly because our group dynamic was not easy. We all had our part in it in the way we worked with the tension. I appreciate how committed you are to what you do - in this case our project. You brought a lot of ideas to the table from your work experience which enhanced the  quality of our UX and gave us interesting aspects and problems to solve (i.e. finding a way to set up a new company account and a store admin in one process). I very much appreciate how much you care about the people around you and I am happy we got to know each other better. In discussions about how to do things I wish you were a bit more open to hear others' ideas and inputs and think them through before you come to a conclusion. I know this tendency from myself. That is probably why we butted heads quite a bit. But for me it was just about the project and my way of trying to understand what makes most sense. Also, I think it would have helped everyone if we communicated more how to implement features throughout the project (especially during the weekend) so everyone could be on board with each others strategies and help each other out. You did so much work on this project but I didn't really know throughout how you were doing things. We could have probably saved a lot of time we spent on debugging if we knew more and could give some input in each others work. We got so exhausted because of the amount of work but I am happy we kept the style and could turn in this good of a product in the end. - Claudia


## Community

* Led a Mini Group Retro / plan on being involved in each one from here on out!
* Student Mentor for new cohort.
* Volunteer with the Boys and Girls club.


### Playing a Part

* Attended 4 Community/Demo night for Grads

* Led a Micro Group!


### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

Ling, working with you has been a unique and knowledge experience. You are smart, motivated, and determined. I appreciated your ideas and approaches of trying new strategies and taking on challenges that you felt you can tackle. Its great to question your peers about an approach so everyone can improve from it, however I would recommend for future reference, allow your teammate to explain there approach before giving them your advice. Communication is key to proper teamwork, allowing a team member to explain something fully then following up with more questions until you fully understand their approach would help you give better ideas in order to help out your team member.
