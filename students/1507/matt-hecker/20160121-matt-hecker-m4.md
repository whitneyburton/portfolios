This module has been alot of off-road learning to me


Alot of figuring out what I would enjoy working on. I had this idea at the start of the session that there was alot of wisdom in the idea of specializing in something ( a combination of stories from passionate programmer, podcast, youtubes. )

I turned this into an exercise in user experience. I wanted it to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible.

"but its just a crud app."

It still ended up being very educational!

* Is there really a reason to show the form to create a new idea while searching?

* Do we keep results filtered after search box loses focus?

* When do we go back to not filtering results?

on gametime it was about different ways to doing things programmatically
I completely redid parts of the project and learned afterwards that in those was employing purely declarative programming.

declarative programming is. (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming))
a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

I had a whole bunch of moving objects with changing properties that followed specific rules, rather than having the logic dictate those properties and rules to the objects as the game progressed all the objects knew how they were supposed to interact from the outset and to animate the game I simply had to hand those objects to very few generic functions.

This was about Node for me. Im really intrigued by Node and its contrasting philosophy to rails (convention and all in one tool vs many small composable tools). I went into this project with a willful ignorance of how any Node frameworks worked. I wanted to see what it would take to emulate my favorite parts of rails in node.

* Made a sort of asset pipeline that only gets precompiled AFTER deploy to heroku (minus filename fingerprinting couldn't figure that out)

* made a logical require structure that kept socket and app settings as far away from the entry file as possible

* made controllers(routers) and figured out how to namespace those routers similar to rails controllers.

#### Community:
Previous modules have been about being in public (going to improv, doing student lead sessions). This module has been about getting comfortable talking one on one with people about anything in particular. I've paired with students in other cohorts and this cohort more freely this session and had fun doing so, usually as a follow up to the student lead sessions I did with Alon In the previous session(module 1 review).

#### Going Forward:
Looking forward to sort of stepping up my paper game (resume, personal website, cover letters) with the free time. Also looking to start more conversation with potential employers.
