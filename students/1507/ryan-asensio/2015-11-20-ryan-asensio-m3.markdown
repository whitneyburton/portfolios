# Ryan Asensnio - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my goal was to distinguish myself from my peers by learning unique skills and pursuing my personal interests. I also wanted to being preparing for the job hunt. I was not able to learn any new marketable skill son my own, but feel like I have learned a lot about the assigned topics this module. I was able to put together a paper and interactive resume.

### Individual Projects

The individual projects for this module are as follows:

#### APICurious 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/github-mock)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

I did not find this project particularly challening or interesting, but it did successfully incrase my confidence in dealing with APIs.


 * Completion: 3: Developer delivered all planned features.
 * Organization: 1: Developer failed to use a project management tool to track its progress.
 * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
 * Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
 * User Experience: 3: The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

##### Takeaway

  * APIs aren't scary
  * I do a lot better on projects that are challenging/interesting
  * Teams help me stay motivated

#### Rails Engine

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/rails_engine)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

  This project was probably the most stressful of the module, and maybe even ever for my time thus far at Turing. That being said, it was also probably one of my favorite. I enjoyed being able to just 'crank out' the easier portions, and then there was also a lot of time for personal exploration. In the end, I got everything figured out and was able to give a hand to my peers.


 * Completion: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
 * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
 * Code Quality: 3.5: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
 * API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
 * Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

##### Takeaway

  * Learning is fun
  * Database stuff is fun
  * Woohoo

#### Personal Project (FeedBee)

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/feedbee)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

  Greatly enjoyed working on my own idea. I have been thinking about making this since before the beginning of Turing, and it is one of the reasons why I came. Technical things I learned more about include...

  * AJAX
  * Polymorphic Relationships in Rails
  * Google APIs
  * Ranking system
  * Semantic UI

  TEST SCORES

  * Completion: 4
  * Organization: 4 
  * TDD: 4
  * Code Quality: 4
  * User Experience: 4
  * Performance: 4

##### Takeaway

  * Learning is fun
  * I am a developer!
  * I want to work on this project full-time at some point.

### Group Projects

Following is the only group project completed this module.

#### The Pivot

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/the_pivot)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

  This project seemed to just be a lot of work. There was some tricky routing in the beginning and few interesting extra features (downloading zip files), but overall wasn't too tricky. Definitely solidified my understanding of core Rails principles.

 * Completion: 4
 * Organization: 4
 * Progress: 3
 * Test-Driven Development: 3
 * Code Quality: 3
 * User Experience: 3

##### My Contribution

 * Team Lead
 * RESTful routes
 * Donloading multiple files and zipping them together for the user
 * Photo CRUD functionality
  
##### Takeaway

 * Group work is fun, but tiring
 * Basic Rails stuff isn't too hard
 * Group organization can play a big part in a project
