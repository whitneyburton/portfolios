# Travis Gregory - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for Module 3 were to develope a better understanding of React and build on to that with Redux and Router. At the end of this mod I do have a better understanding of React but I did not get to where I wanted to be with Redux and Router.

#### Goals for Module 3 (reapeating)
* Pair with everyone that will take the time
* Be more confident in my knowledge
* Be more involved in the Community
* Continue pairing with earlier mods when possible
* Think more deeply about where I want to be after Turing
* Be more of a leader in my mod

## A: End of Module Assessment

## Instructor Evaluation Points: Self Directed Project
## Instructor: Jhun
## Comments:

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/tlgreg86/hobby-tube)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

In this project we are tasked with creating an app that utilized React, Redux, possibly a backend, and API's. Not only did the application need to have clean JSX, it needed to have testing.

### Completion

2: Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set during check-ins.

### Organization

3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
Technical Quality

### Test-Driven Development

2: Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).

### Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.
Product Experience

### User Experience

3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

### Performance

4: Project pages load on average under 300 milliseconds.

## B: Group Work & Projects

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/JustynaField/headcount2.0)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

## Headcount 2.0

## Students: Travis and Justyna

## Evaluator: Meeka

## Notes:

### Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.

### PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

### CSS/Design

3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

### Testing

Not expected to update this project, teammates should focus on next testing in SwapiBox.

2 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

## SWAPIbox

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/star-wars-api)

[Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## Students: Travis, Spencer

## Instructor: Jhun, Taylor, Meeka

## Notes:

Recommendation that when you get back from the weekend, merge your branches and document every bug and every thing that you would want to fix. Not to actually fix, but to be able to revisit this project when you want to refactor something or refresh on it.

Recommendation to do api calls in the componentDidMount instead of WillMount.

Watch your naming for functions like onClick - this means something else in React world - and also it isn't very clear to the next developer in the code.

Looking at your stubs, you're in mod 3 how - you can refactor those better - Jhun

### Specification Adherence

2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

## MovieTracker

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/anderswood/movie-tracker)

[Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

## Students: Travis, Laura, Anders

## Instructor: Taylor

### Specification Adherence

3: Fixed missing features that needed to be finished. Squad.
// 2.5: The application is in a usable state, but is missing 1 or more of the features outlined in the specification above.

### Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.

### JavaScript Style

2.5: Application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

### Testing

2.5: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.

### Workflow

3.5: The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

## C: Professional Skills

During this mod we were asked to take a good amount of time to think about where we want to be after Turing with regards to our careers. We were tasked with coming up with plans and prospects to help get us on track to getting that dream job. During this time I went in and fixed up my LinkedIn and built up a resume that better suit my future as a developer. I also reached out to some developers locally in an effort to build some relationships that may down the road help in getting me in to a job that I enjoy.

## D: Gear Up

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Parable of The Polygons

- Depending on the types of people in the management position, jobs could quickly become filled with one type of person rather than a diverse group.
- My thoughts towards quotas is mixed still. While I agree with the notion that the workplace should be diverse, I also believe that the most qualified person should get the job. Bringing someone in to a position just based on their race, gender, or age leaves a lot of room for a lower quality employee to be hired. Quotas force something that should be natural.
- I think just addressing the issue in the workplace and talking openly about it really makes a difference. Most people aren't consciously biased so if it is brought up they will become aware of it and change.
- Turing just needs to keep practicing what they preach. If the school continues to be an open and diverse place then the people coming and going will take that mindset with them. Just keep talking about the issue and making people aware of their own biases.
- Its goal was to show how individual biases can become a larger societal issue and how they can influence diversity positively or negatively.

### MicroAggresions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

In this session we spoke in depth about microagressions. In my group we spoke about how this term has been effective in identifying what we called unattended racism, sexism, and bigotry that has been bread in to us since childhood. Coming from an immigrant family I experience MA's all the time but the people in my group coming from privelaged upbringings had a difficult time relating. What we did find though was that the term is beginning to be abused and used in such a way that people are taking to many things and turning them in to micro-agressions.

### Ethicas and Technology of the Snowden Leaks

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

Questions

1. If I were in the same situation I would do the same thing but I'm not sure I would do it in the open. I believe the information needs to be out there but its not worth ruining my life and that of my familys in the process.

2. - Benefits: Ignorance is bliss. People are less fearful of their government when they don't know what they are doing behind the scenes. The government can do some of what they say (anti-terrorism).
 - Detriments: People don't realize their rights are being abused or in some cases taken away.

3. - Benefits: Exposing the tech to other countries or just letting them know of its existence so they can put safeguards in place against it. It also makes it so Americans can also protect themselves.
 - Detriments: Disclosing this technology to the world leaves our country open to threats and also strains international relations.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### From me to Justyna:
Working with Justyna was a great experience. She is very organized and driven when working with her projects. I learned a lot about testing from working with her. Justyna also did a great job at bringing me back from the edge when I would get stressed out about parts of the project. The biggest thing I would recommend Justyna work on would be her confidence in her abilities. During or project she would quickly get anxious when we came across a problem we couldn’t quickly solve but in the end we made it work. I think Justyna is highly capable developer despite what she may think sometimes and look forward to pairing with her in the future.

#### From me to Spencer:
It was great getting to work with Travis on SWAPI-box this mod. The project was a struggle but Travis never gave up working on it and contributed throughout the entire project. It was nice to have someone to struggle through the project with. Even though he is probably repeating I think that he is a strong coder and he will be one of the top students next mod. I think the only suggestion that I have would be to take the lead on projects to ensure that you have an understanding of the code base. Hopefully in repeating you will be able to teach other people some of the concepts which I think will be really beneficial for you.

#### From me to Laura:
Laura was really quick to jump in to the project and had a good understanding of the material going in. She was able to speak to her decisions and explain to me what was happening when I was stuck. The thing I would most recommend she work on is her awareness of when someone in her group is struggling with the material. This did eventually happen later in our project and Lauras help was greatly appreciated. That help was instrumental in getting me to a point of better understanding of React and Redux. Laura was also really positive even when we were stuck and as a result lowered my stress level.

#### From me to Anders:
Working with Anders on MovieTracker and the UX/UI project was a great learning experience. Listening to him work through problems helped me come to a better understanding of how Redux works. At times though I did find his process to be a little confusing and hard to keep up with as we worked in our group. My biggest recommendation would be to be more empathetic/aware of when teammates are struggling with project material. There were times during our project that I felt somewhat dismissed because of my shaky understanding but in the end though, post project, Anders took the time to really go through Redux and help me come to a better understanding of the flow of data. Without that pairing time I doubt I would have the understanding I now have of Redux. If he has time in mod 4 I think it would be to my benefit to pair with him more. Anders is a very organized, driven, developer and I look forward to working with him in the future.

### Getting Feedback

#### From Justyna:
What I really admire about Travis is his very strong perseverance in working through the project and making sure that none of the iterations stays incomplete. Travis was a huge support for me when I felt stressed and overwhelmed by the project. He maintained a cool head throughout the entire time, and was really good about keeping us on track. Travis is always available and eager to work. I enjoyed working together with Travis.

#### From Spencer:
Spencer was a great partner to work with on SWAPI. Going in to the project I felt that we were on the same page with regards to our knowledge and when I did struggle with parts he was super understanding and quick to stop and help me understand. The biggest thing I would recommend Spencer work on is his confidence in what he knows. Spencer exhibited an understanding of concepts that he would sometimes convince himself he didn’t get. Overall though working with Spencer was a great experience, he was easy to work with and I intend on pairing with him often next mod.

#### From Laura:
Travis, thank you for being an excellent partner for Movie Tracker. I know that you struggled with some of the material in this project, and you did an excellent job of making sure you were contributing to the group work. I am sorry I did not gauge your comfort with the material earlier on; I would encourage you to be more vocal about what you needed from the group. I appreciated that you recognized areas that you wanted to grow and took on those aspects of the project; pushing yourself to be uncomfortable and to struggle through problems and ask for assistance too! Your growth mindset is awesome!

#### From Anders:
Working with Travis on the movie tracker project was a great experience- he was always upbeat and fun to work with- which is critical during a hard project. If I got frustrated with the project or hangry, it was always nice when Travis would crack a joke to lighten things up. Redux didn't click with Travis at first but he stuck with it, doing tutorials in his own time to help the concepts stick. I really admire this perseverance and doggedness- I think it will serve him well in his developer career. I'm looking forward to working with Travisv going forward.

### Playing a Part
During this mod I really tried to dig in to doing the Turing Podcast and I did for the first few weeks but the workload got to be a too much for me to do on top of planning, recording, and editing the podcast. I'm hoping by repeating the mod I'll get a better handle on the material giving me more time to participate in the community.
