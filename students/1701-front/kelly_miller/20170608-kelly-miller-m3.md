## A: End of Module Assessment


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The self-directed project was a really great experience. It was wonderful getting to work on a project that was 
especially meaningful for me and to set my own pace.

#### Self-Directed 
*   [sd-proj-github](https://github.com/kellymiller6/ourchildren)
*   [self-directed-project-assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

This was a two week project working with a 'client' (instructor) from idea to completion. For this project I chose
to create an app for foster parents using react, router, and firebase. As the project went on to solve a bug
and further my understanding I chose to implement redux. I also worked to encrypt the data at rest which was an interesting
and fun process.



# Instructor Evaluation Points: Self-Directed
# Instructor:Jhun
# Comments:
### Feature Delivery

**2. Performance**

* 3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.



## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects taught me a lot about myself and were overall a good experience.
I thought this mod my group projects went even smoother than last mod. I was better able to navigate and communicate with 
my partners. It was especially interesting working a group of four. It made communication extremely important as well
as making sure there was some equality in the contributions.


#### headcount2.0

## Students: Breana Knight, Kelly Miller
## Evaluator: Meeka
## Notes: https://github.com/kellymiller6/headcount2.0

## Specification Adherence
- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality
- 4 - Developer demonstrates complete understanding of React with appropriately separated components and exceptionally well refactored code.

## PropType Implementation

- Pass! - https://github.com/kellymiller6/headcount2.0/commit/8bd59e8fd5748ff8cae181acbbdca2c029f047b2

 - There are components missing proptype validation.

## CSS/Design

- 3 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has multiple recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

- 4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested


#### Swapibox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kellymiller6/swapi-box)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

## SWAPIbox

Students: Keji, Kelly

Instructor: Meeka

### Specification Adherence

3.5 - The application completes all 3 iterations.

### Code Quality

3.5 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

### Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

### Testing

4 - Every component is tested from both a unit and acceptance standpoint, all crucial functionality is tested

#### Movie-tracker

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kellymiller6/movie-tracker)
*   [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

**MOVIE SPEC**:

Iteration 0:
* Pull in movie API
* Pull most recent movies from MovieDB API.
* Display each movie on root index /

Iteration 1:
* Sign In / Sign Out Functionality
* Be able to sign in on page /login and redirect user to /
* Flash "Email and Password do not match" - if password is incorrect
* Ability to create a user.
* Flash "Email has already been used" - if email has been taken
* Should only take legit emails - regex - Extension

Iteration 2: Favorites
* Each movie should be displayed with a favorite button.
* If the user is not signed in and clicks on a favorite button the user will be prompted with the request to create an account.
* Validate favorites before adding to db. Aka does that user already have the movie stored as favorites.
* If the user visits /favorites they should see a list of all their favorite movies.
* Once on /favorites the user should have the option to delete the movie.


### Specification Adherence  

* 3: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.


### JavaScript Style

* 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.




### Giving Feedback

To Justyna: It was a wonderful experience getting to work with Justyna on MovieTracker this mod. It was my first time working 
with her and I would happily do it again. I could tell she was unsure of her redux abilities especially early on but did a 
great job asking for clarification throughout. I have found when I don't know what's going on the best way to learn is to ask
to drive and have my partner(s) tell me what they would do - maybe this is something she could do in the future when unsure. 
Her contributions to the styling of the project were amazing. It's the project I picked for my portfolio and a large part of
that was because of the design.

To Leta: It was great working with Leta for the first time during Movie-Tracker. She provided much needed organization and 
communication - making sure everyone was on the same page and scheduled extra work time. We both probably could have been 
more vocal about contributing to the code early in the project, but you worked hard on the organizing and scheduling and then 
came in and make HUGE contributions with the testing.



### Being a Community Member
From Leta: I hadn't gotten the chance to work with Kelly before MovieTracker, and it was great! Kelly is organized, calm, and
just easy to work with. She's willing to jump in and try things and is good at checking in and making sure everyone is on the
same page. 10 out of 10, would work with again.

From Keji Amos:
I appreciated that we had similar backgrounds, coming from education. I think that was very useful in allowing us to work well 
together. You're organized, a good planner, and you're a quick study.

From Justyna: It was a great experience working with Kelly. She is very easy to work with. We had good communication. I particularly enjoyed working together on routing and how we discussed different ways to approach it, it was a good give and take. I would be happy to work with Kelly again.


### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
I made efforts especially during retros and other cohort specific times to become an active participant in the community. 
In addition I participated in a couple of pairings and joined the Pahlka spikes most weeks. I really enjoyed being a 
member of ironFe this mod and hope to contribute more in the future. I also try to get a read on the mood in the classroom
and do what I can to lift it during times of group stress.
