# Pentathlon: Static Comp Challenge

## Evaluator: Robbie

### Design Integrity

- 4: The comp beautifully articulates the original design intent and there are no areas where an instructor would make changes with respect to color, layout, imagery, spatial relationship of graphical elements.

### Responsive Layout

- 4: The comp is fully responsive and there are no areas where the instructor would make changes.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing. Developer employs basic use of semantic tags and makes additional effort where applicable to write accessible markup.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.



--------------------------------


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Solo projects!

#### Number Guesser

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/number-guesser)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was our first solo project (excluding Dog Party). It's also the first (and, so far, only) time I've cried during this program!

I had my eval with Robbie (who yelled alarmingly the whole time). He pointed out the areas where my Javascript could be dried up, which was really helpful.

## Evaluator: Robbie

## Notes:

### UX/UI Expectations

- 3.5: Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

### Functional Expectations

- 4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

### Fundamental HTML

- 3.5:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

### Fundamental CSS

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

### Fundamental JavaScript

- 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax





#### Static Comp Challenge 1

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/lk-comp-challenge-1)
*   [GitHub Pages URL](https://letakeane.github.io/lk-comp-challenge-1/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

After Dog Party, this was our first real stab at coding out a static comp.

Major comments from the group eval were concerned with making sure I kept the design fat-finger-friendly.




#### Static Comp Challenge 2

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/lk-comp-challenge-2)
*   [GitHub Pages URL](https://letakeane.github.io/lk-comp-challenge-2/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This was the project that made me realize Mod 1 has poisoned me and made me believe that just adding "Box" makes any project more exciting, since I named this site "RecipeBox".

The group eval was positive, with main comments concerning how to handle wrapping text in a user-friendly way (no tiny scrollbars or windows!). I did keep fat-finger-friendliness in mind :)




#### Static Comp Challenge 3

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/lk-comp-challenge-3)
*   [GitHub Pages URL](https://letakeane.github.io/lk-comp-challenge-3/)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

The last static comp of Mod 1. Had a lot of fun with this one, actually!

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### LinkedList

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LisaBaird/linkedlistLL)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

LinkedList was our very first paired project. I worked with Lisa Baird. She and I had fairly different learning objectives for this project, but melded them effectively. After the project was over, Lisa and I had a retro. She said she was pleased with our level of collaboration, and appreciated that we solved problems together and articulated our thought processes, rather than one person steamrolling the other.

## Evaluator: Bree

- option to fix functional expectations w/ respect to user feedback in the disabled state of enter button and/or at least an error feedback message from the spec
- option to revisit js for some refactoring hints to up the score to a 3

### Functional Expectations

- 2.5: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.

### Fundamental JavaScript Style

- 2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

### Workflow

- 3: The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

### HTML Style

- 3:  Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

### CSS Style

- 3:  Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.



#### IdeaBox

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/ideabox)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox was our second paired project. I worked with Spencer Hilvitz. We had very similar work styles and learning goals, and worked together effectively. In fact, it was a great partnership, and we led a Friday spike about using sprites together the week of our project evaluation (at the encouragement of Louisa).

#### 2DoBox Pivot!

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/letakeane/2DoBox---Pivot)
*   [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

Our final paired project. Zane Russell and I worked together. It was a great experience! Zane had stronger skills in Javascript, but we built a good partnership and ended up solving a lot of problems collaboratively. I asked to drive for about 50% of the time we were working side by side, which helped reduce any inadvertent steamrolling. Zane, on his part, was very instructive and I did not ever feel like I was out of my depth as we were working.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Growth mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

I (like most of us) come from a fixed mindset educational background. I avoided subjects I didn't master immediately because I wanted to avoid being seen to be "bad" at something. There's a Ted Talk by Reshma Saujani about how girls are pressured to be perfect - on the first try.

Coming to Turing, I definitely had a fixed mindset, even though I knew, intellectually, that it was garbage. Over the course of this mod, I've worked to get better at being comfortable with messing up and flailing.


#### Getting better at difficult things

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

More growth mindset! Lean into being bad at stuff! Embrace the power of "yet"! This was just reinforcing the foundation set in the last Gear Up session.



#### Managing stress and coping mechanisms

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_managing_stress.md)

Our coping mechanisms for dealing with stress are fine, in moderation. Vegging with Netflix? Grabbing a beer? All fine, so long as they don't lead into pits of passivity and avoidance. I enjoyed seeing what everyone else did or aims to do to alleviate stress.



#### Debugging the Gender Gap

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_5_debugging_gender_gap.md)

I had this in my netflix queue, haha. It was not hugely surprising, but I really enjoyed the small group discussion afterward! Turing is a bit of a bubble, so it was obviously a fairly progressive conversation, but it was good and reinforced the need to balance empathy with self-worth.



### PROtocol
#### Feedback 1

*   [Link to PROtocol slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1f0cDlu4u5ZnM0WjpCpPfBcCJ9n3qRknqYjaqh8DdJVs/edit#slide=id.g1c505a3b55_0_0)

I've had similar training (both formal and informal) at previous jobs. It was nice to talk about it explicitly - the need to be aware of and check our initial emotional reactions to receiving criticism, and the need to be aware of those dynamics when giving criticism. It was interesting to hear the categories of triggers - for me, truth is a big one. I think the biggest takeaways are the importance of being kind and offering concrete, actionable suggestions with feedback.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding I

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
*   [Link to Completed Deliverables: linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/letakeane/)

Looking over the github page for this session, I don't recall actually getting to any of this. We just set up linkedin, github, stackoverflow, and twitter accounts.


#### Learning to Pair

*   [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md)
*   [Link to my DTR questionnaire](https://goo.gl/forms/s7bnOlbJaQ1DU2ej1)
*   [Link to a DTR memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1165UaGfp6W5kQsKK8PwgN2-1Uugip99ShRi3PyeO4Os/edit?usp=sharing)

I love this concept. I hope to bring this to any future jobs I have - I think it's really good to establish a shared baseline to refer to, and to open up that pattern of honest communication from the get go.




## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

From me to Michael Fenwick:
Working with you on two different projects was helpful. I appreciated that you listened and offered suggestions, instead of pushing us to solve a problem the same way you did. I thought you did a great job checking in and gauging the skill level of me and my partner, and you checked in to make sure we were following along with you. I appreciated your willingness to really look at our existing code to see how we were working, rather than just pulling up your code and showing us what you'd done. tl;dr 10/10 would pair again!

From me to Spencer Hilvitz:
I really enjoyed working with you, both on IdeaBox and on our sprites spike! I appreciated that you were proactive with communication. Struggling with the jQuery felt bearable because we were both open about how tough it was, and I think we came up with good solutions together.  Putting together a very last minute spike also felt like a breeze, because you are so calm and collected :slightly_smiling_face: It was easy in both the project and the spike to divvy up tasks, because I knew you'd be vocal about any issues or reservations you had.

Thanks for a great paired project experience!




### Being a Community Member

From Michael Fenwick to me:
Pairing with Leta has been great. On both occasions Leta has known exactly what was required which made pairing extremely easy.
Leta’s code was very well written and easy to dive into and understand what has going on. When pairing, Leta was open to trying different approaches to solve the same problem and immediately looked at ways to refactor her code.
It was clear to see that Leta knew what was going on with her code and that she only needed the smallest of nudges in the right direction before she was off writing code to solve the issues that were faced.
I can tell that Leta is going to do extremely well at Turing and I look forward to pairing with her again.

From Spencer Hilvitz to me:
Thank you for being such a great project partner. IdeaBox was one of the most stressful projects that I had to get through and you asking clarifying questions, both of me and of our pairing partner, was incredibly helpful and informative. Thank you for taking the brunt of the work for the Sprite Spike and for teaching me how to use them on the project. I appreciated the fact that even though there were stressful portions of IdeaBox, we were always able to work through a problem together and ensure that we got the project done on time and finished with a great grade. Thank you, also, for creating the DTR before the project. It gave us a good foundation for moving forward on the project. I look forward to working on projects and Spikes with you in the future!




### Playing a Part

I joined the Joan Clarke posse and the Bezos posses and have found them to be super informative, and just great opportunities to connect with people cross -module and -program. I might take over the Bezos posse next mod (it'll be leaderless and I've been talking with Jon Kimble about curriculum, etc).

I also took the plunge and led a mostly-off-the-cuff Friday spike with Spencer Hilvitz, which was both less stressful than I'd imagined and more fun.

I'm really looking forward to pairing with future Mod1 students (presuming I move on to Mod2), and I hope that my type A organizational skills will be helpful.
