# Spencer Hilvitz (aka adam) - (M3) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to gain a strong grasp on react and become more comfortable hitting APIs and dealing with that returned information.
I also set out to gain a stronger understanding of react testing.

## Rubric Scores

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

I passed the End of Module Assessment. I am looking forward to coding some of the projects over again over the break and really getting a handle on passing objects and working on Array prototypes.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### AmIRite?

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/amirite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

My project was basically a way for me to get a better handle on the main languages of this mod. I wanted to make sure that I had a good understanding of React, Redux, Routes and testing. I was really happy with the work that I did on the project, even though I'm not super excited about where the project is right now. I am looking forward to building more on the project.

The project itself was allowing users to add a question and then to have other users vote on who they think is right in the situation. I also brought in a news API to better understand fetch and was able to implement middleware successfully as well. I feel like I finally have a good grasp on languages as well as fetch and promises.

I was also very pleased that I was able to implement active D3 on my project and I look forward to working more with that in the future.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### HeadCount 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/headcount2.0)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 was a project designed to have us manipulate data and JSON objects. It was also supposed to give us a better understanding of React and how to pass information from one component to another. I worked with Leta and while the project was a struggle, I think that going back to it and getting it done would be significantly easier.

Students: Leta Keane & Spencer Hilvitz

Evaluator: Taylor

Notes:

UI - add a legend to help users understand what the numbers indicate. Refactoring, reusing the Card component. Understanding what your data is at all time with PropType. What needs to be held in state, try not to duplicate things help on App.

Specification Adherence

3 - The application completes 5 iterations.
Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.
PropType Implementation

Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props. Make sure to understand the data flow.
CSS/Design

2.5 - Developer has made intentional design decisions to create a user friendly application but Louisa would be mad.
Testing

2.5 - A valid attempt was made to test functionality with obvious gaps where functionality is not tested

#### SWApi Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/hilvitzs/star-wars-api)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

SWAPI-Box was a project that was meant to test our knowledge of React and API calls. We had to render information from API calls on cards. The most challenging part of the project was getting the nested API calls taken care of from within the components on which they needed to be rendered. I thought it was very helpful for Array Prototype methods as well.


Travis and I both struggled on this project. Again, I think going back to the project would be significantly easier now. I have a much better grasp of API calls and where to do them as well as React.)


Students: Travis, Spencer

Instructor: Jhun, Taylor, Meeka

Notes:

Recommendation that when you get back from the weekend, merge your branches and document every bug and every thing that you would want to fix. Not to actually fix, but to be able to revisit this project when you want to refactor something or refresh on it.

Recommendation to do api calls in the componentDidMount instead of WillMount.

Watch your naming for functions like onClick - this means something else in React world - and also it isn't very clear to the next developer in the code.

Looking at your stubs, you're in mod 3 how - you can refactor those better - Jhun

Specification Adherence

2.5 - The application is in a usable state, but is missing some of the features outlined in the specification above.

Code Quality

3 - Developer appears comfortable in React. There are minor opportunities to refactor.

Design

3 - Some changes requested by evaluator.

Testing

3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing

#### MovieTracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/DBULL7/movie_tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

MovieTracker was meant to increase our understanding of React and to use Redux for the first time. We also needed to set up a database and to use local storage in order to remember users and their favorites. We needed to use API calls and had the option to use middleware which we did use on this project.

This project was by far the most difficult for me. I did NOT have a good understanding of Redux or of Fetch or databases before. I am looking forward to taking a deeper look into this project and possible doing my own version over break in order to make sure that I understand everything is happening. I think that I have a much better handle on Redux now that I have worked on my personal project and would be interested to see how much easier it would be.)

Specification Adherence

4: The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Redux Architecture

3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

3: Application is a single page and uses the React Router but does not display the appropriate components upon navigating.
JavaScript Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


## D: Professional Skills
This mods focus has been on job searches. They asked us to start making specific actions toward finding the type of work that we would like to do. We did things like the Flower Exercise in order to define more specifically the type of job we are looking for. We also needed to create a resume and write a personal story.

### Gear Up
#### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

Parable of The Polygons

This gear up was meant to help us understand the impact that even small amounts of prejudice can have. While a lot of people are not actively racist or sexist, preferring to work with people that are like you can have pretty significant effects on segregation and the work place. We had an interesting discussion regarding anonymous interviews and the positive impact that it can have on subconscious bias and/or prejudice.)

#### MicroAggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group2.md)

This gear up was aimed at helping us understand actions that we could take upon seeing microaggressions. We were given different scenarios and asked how we would handle them and our group had a good discussion regarding whether the term itself can be helpful to society. It was also aimed at reminding us that everyone has subconscious bias and that we need to actively work on ensuring that those are lessened with conscious effort.

#### Ethics and Technology of the Snowden Leaks

* [GitHub URL](https://gist.github.com/blackknight75/c7ef4e8ef1a197d50593bce078fc9d7f)

This was probably the most interesting gear up that I participate in. The point of this gear up was to talk about the Snowden leaks and to basically consider what we would have done in the same situation. The biggest takeaway from this is that privacy vs security is still something that a lot of people struggle with. We actually had a person in our group argue for the NSA and it was interesting to hear their perspective since I wholeheartedly disagree. Overall it was a very successful student-led gear up session.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I played my part in the community by helping other people in my cohort through their projects. I got to help Travis and Justyna through HeadCount 2.0 which was a huge benefit to my understanding. I participated in group whiteboarding sessions and have helped other students through their frustrations and hardtimes throughout the mod.

Feedback:

From Leta: 'Spencer and I have worked together a lot - and it's awesome. Sorry, Taylor. Spencer brings the drive, I bring the calm - we're a good team. There are always times when we're not sure we'll make it through, but we always end up pulling it together by the last minute. Hoping we go 4 for 4 as project partners!'

From Travis: 'Spencer was a great partner to work with on SWAPI. Going in to the project I felt that we were on the same page with regards to our knowledge and when I did struggle with parts he was super understanding and quick to stop and help me understand. The biggest thing I would recommend Spencer work on is his confidence in what he knows. Spencer exhibited an understanding of concepts that he would sometimes convince himself he didn’t get. Overall though working with Spencer was a great experience, he was easy to work with and I intend on pairing with him often next mod.'
