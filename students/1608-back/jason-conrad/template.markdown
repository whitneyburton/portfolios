# (Jason Conrad) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

At the beginning of the module we were asked why we came to Turing. As I was
preparing for this portfolio I went back and read it. I said that I wanted to
be in a career where I was not only doing something that I loved but something
that I was passionate about. I didn't realize how quickly I would be able to say
that I am doing something that I love and that I am passionate about and for that
I already count this module as a success in my book. I set out with the hope that I
would have an fundamental understanding of Ruby. While there is definitely much room
growth in that area (and let's be honest if anyone ever says they fully understand
ruby then more than likely they are either lying to you, themselves, or both).
I also said from day one that the only person I would myself to was the me from yesterday
and as long as I understood more then I did the day before that I was on the right track.
Looking back and seeing all that I've learned and have accomplished in the past 6 weeks
completely blows my mind and makes more than anxious for the days ahead.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

Nice flow of writing tests, getting them to pass
Several times went back to rewrite tests, instead of locating source of error in code
Debugging weak: glossed over test results, rarely able to trace test results back to source issue
Dart-board-based Development: knock it off!
Struggled to describe fundamentals
Testing: some sound implementation, a few cases where testing setup demonstrated lack of clarity about test's goal
Rubric

Students will be evaluated according to the following rubric:

Notes

1. Ruby Syntax & API
2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

2. Completion and Progress
2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.

3. Testing
2: Developer uses and writes tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover

4. Workflow
3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

5. Collaboration
2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops

6. Enumerable & Collections
n/a


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following were individual projects

#### (Jungle Beats)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdconrad89/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this project we're going to do some silly things with sound. Specifically, we're going to make a very basic drum machine program.

However to add some additional depth, let's also use this project as a chance to explore one of the fundamental data structures in computer science -- the Linked List.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

Completed I2, started work on I3
code uses iterative approach
Would like to have seen tests check for more edge cases,
There is some redundancy in tests, and they dont really test the full functionality of I2.
Some confusion about attr_ shortcuts.
Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations

1: Application is missing more than one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

What Jon had to say:
Jason you were a great teammate to have on a project.  You worked hard on Enigma and were willing to spend long hours at Turing and maintain a positive attitude, even when it was late and you still had a long train ride home. This positive attitude and your attention to detail were huge assets.  If there was one piece of feedback I would give it would be to ask questions if you don’t understand a piece of code. Besides that you were a great teammate. I appreciate your longterm mindset when in comes to coding and would be happy to work on another project with you!

What Mike had to say:
Jason was a great partner during the Enigma project.  Although he had the longest commute (by far!), he made coordination easy.  I distinctly remember he even missed a train on the final night of the project.  He is generally easygoing and funny, which makes working with him enjoyable.  One opportunity for Jason would be his willingness to speak up when he is either lost or in need of help.  I look forward to working with Jason again.

What Brett had to say:
Jason was a great project partner.  He was always eager to pair when at Blake and was good to work with when we were not in the same physical location.  With all of the issues we had, I feel like he still brought the best out of me.

## D: Professional Skills
This module I made a conscious effort to attend every Gear Up and be attentive to the topics that were being discussed. Below are my responses from the Gear Up sessions.



### Gear Up
#### (Getting Better at Difficult Things)
I feel like the part of the session that really spoke to me was that how we are emotionally
can really affect the way that we learn. Throughout my time so far here I have definitely
noticed a correlation between how well I am able to pay attention and retain information and
my current emotional state. So staying aware of your emotions and not letting them
get the best of you is very important while learning, especially in a high stress environment.




### Gear Up
#### (There is an I in team)
[GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)
In our group we discussed the importance of not only communicating our thoughts but
more importantly actively listening to what other people are saying. When you make a conscious
effort to listen to people you are less likely to misinterpret the points that they
are trying to make. Actively listening can go a long way in the effort of improving team dynamics.



### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

Overall i thought that the session was very informative and eye opening. I feel like
a lot of people don't realize how serious of an issue it really was. the only thing that I
would say about the session that I would've changed is that I would've like to have had some more
conversation around how we can change it. It seems like a lot of the movie and the
conversation seemed to be centered around shining a light on the issue and bringing
attention to it and not too much conversation around how companies are going about bucking the trend.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://github.com/jdconrad89)

I was really surprised how different the job search process was since the last time
that I looked for a job. Everywhere that I applied had a focus on resumes but it seems like the process
is more streamlined now with sites like Linked In. I was interested at the amount of things that
they suggested that you put on your account ranging from your git hub website to projects you've created.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
What I said about Brett Rivers:
Brett would always make me feel included in conversations that he was in. He was also willing to help with issues earlier in the module when we weren’t working together.

What I said about Dan Olson:
Dan was a great addition to the community. He advocated for our module in the SAB and was always interested to hear how we felt about things and how we were doing. He was also always available to help with things that we may not understand and there was many a time where we were here late at night working out similar issues together. He definitely made the community and overall experience far more pleasant.

What I said about Jon Kimble:
Jon was a great person to work wth. He was very insightful in not only how we should plan out
our project but also in ways that we could solve problems that we were working with. He was
very willing to put the time in to work on our projects and get things done, both coming
in on the weekend for extended periods of time as well as staying late after class. He had a
positive attitude even when we would run into issues and that made for a positive working
environment.

What I said about Mike Scherer:
Mike was great to work with. He was extremely dedicated to  getting the work done.
He was always willing to stay late and come in on the weekend. He was very creative
in some of the ideas he had for how we could get things in our project to work. He never
appeared to let the stress of the project get to him when problems would arise and would
take them head which was great for the work environment.

### Being a Community Member

From Brett Rivers:
Jason is a great member of the community; always in a good mood, ready to listen to a problem,or tell a joke. His presence improves my Turing experience.

From Dan Olson:
Jason is an awesome addition to any team. His willingness to help and reach out to those in need is always welcomed. His lighthearted sense of humor and encouraging spirit helped me through some tough times in the module. We worked feverishly on event reporter together and his resolve never waned.
