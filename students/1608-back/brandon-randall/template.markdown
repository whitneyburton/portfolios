# (Brandon Randall) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

My initial goals for mod 1 were to learn the basics of programming and how to work with collections, iterations, methods and learning the syntax of ruby. After learning how to use hashes and how to start functions with empty arrays and hashes, I then developed the goal to use initialize, symbols and attr_reader. After this six weeks, I feel like I am now in position to complete assignments on my own. I feel like I am now also able to be an effective partner during my pairings.

### End of Module Assessment

****Final Assessment****
Headcount
The objective of the final assessment was to create a directory in which certain sections of information could be pulled out if called upon.
### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

### 2. Ruby Style
* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

### 3. Blocks & Enumerations
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

### 4. Testing
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

### 5. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 6. Collaboration
* 2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops

### Projects
**************
COMPLETE ME

The goal of this project is to create a node that passed a part of a word and created an autosuggested word. Then after a certain word has been chosen three times, the autosuggest would move the most chosen word to the primary autosuggested word.
Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/brandonrandall/complete_me.git

Notes:

Bug on select, otherwise addresses base expectations, no extensions
More tests needed, to cover existing methods and supporting methods
Breaking logic into components: need to go farther here
Enumerables solid
1. Functional Expectations

2: Application is missing one base expectation
2. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


Sorting Suite

The goal of this project is to create a node object that passed through an insert method that sends the node places depending on the rating of the node. We also had to different types of insert patterns; bubble, merge and insert sort.

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

Repo here: https://github.com/brandonrandall/1608
Missing sort
TDD: would like to see more unit tests and node/tree divided into different files
Style solid: nice and tight methods
Recursion used to implement functionality where appropriate
Scores:

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

Functional Expectations

2: Application is missing one base expectation
Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

## Community

### Giving Feedback
(feedback from me)
  I dont really feel qualified to give coding feedback yet but I do think this is an enjoyable field and Id
  like more time to learn the basics before continuing.

### Being a Community Member

Gear Ups:

theres an i in team

What did it feel like having to repeat your teammate's comments at the beginning of the exercise and state how you would address his or her concerns? 
How could or would this skill benefit you in a team setting?
I think having to repeat my teammates comments force a genuine response
because we have to be active listeners by repeating what our teammates said.
How was the dynamic of your first conversation different that the second conversation? What concerns or frustrations, if any, remained?
the first topic was about who has made you feel special which was very insightful but the second convo was about ghosts and i dont think anyone in the 
group saw as much purpose in the second convo.

getting better at difficult things

What efforts do you make to manage your learning process? Are these efforts successful?
What challenges have inhibited your ability to manage your learning process effectively?

What role does your emotional state of mind play in your learning? 
How do your successes and failures at learning affect your emotional state?

I think i am able to put away my emotional state to complete any task in life. So
ultimately, i feel that the only obstacle i have to complete at this point
is either random family issues or maybe extensive material with which i need to learn
pre requesites or something along those lines. Other than that, i think with enough time
I can conquer any difficult task.

Giving feedback

Ali Sclerith: Early in the module, Brandon reached out for a social gathering, which I deeply appreciated as I was surrounded by strangers. Since then, he has also reached out for skills support. I appreciate his genuine interest in truly understanding the content, and not just looking for answers. He is a pleasure to work with.

Lee Saville: You're a great guy and I hope you succeed in the future. One suggestion would be to hit the basics really hard so that you can tackle the bigger more complex problems that involve knowing the smaller bits more intimately. I felt that during our group work we had to spend a lot of time going over the more basic things. Cheers!

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

Id like to keep trying to portray positivity at all times and would like to eventually be able to teach those who need help.
