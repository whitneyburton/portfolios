# Daniel Shin - M3 Portfolio

## Overview

Coming into this module, I wanted to have a solid understanding of in-depth Rails, as well as be able to extract my knowledge into other languages, particularly JavaScript. I learned a lot about how complex Rails can be, and how many different ways to approach a solution, despite Rails being a convention-based community.

Despite all the above, I would say the topic of looking for jobs loomed the whole time, and distracted me from absorbing as much information as I could have. In retrospect, I probably shouldn't have spent so much time worrying about what kind of JavaScript / other web language to learn, and just devoted all my energy into becoming a better Rails developer.

## Self Assessment

**A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
I think I spent so much time this module researching / prioritizing about what kind of languages tech jobs typically look for, that I didn't spend as much time as I should have preparing for the final assessment. In fact, I came out of both exams not feeling great, but maybe that's how most of everyone else felt too. I was able to implement core features, but I was never able to complete the assessment 100%.

**B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
I took a risk doing my self-directed project in MongoDB, Express and Node, and I spent a considerable amount of energy into the project. However, I would balance this out with the lack of effort I put into APICurious. The lack of effort is mostly due to being taken back by the Stream session. In retrospect, I do agree that the session was very valuable and gave me insight in how complex Ruby can be, and I probably should have put more effort into the non graded project.

**C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
I devoted all my time to Rales Engine and Cloney Island, both of which I believe turned out to be very good projects. For both projects I tried my best to go out of my comfort zone and do the best that I can.

**D: Professional Skills**: 3
I have been researching companies and doing some cold outreach, but I have not been attending Meetups or doing many Mock Interviews.

**E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 2
I helped out Mod 1 and Mod 2 students when they were stuck on projects that I have already completed, but I have not helped with the community that much.

## Included Projects

The graded projects consisted of Rales Engine, Cloney Island and the Self Directed Project

### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rtravitz/rails-engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)

#### Description
This project introduced me to creating API endpoints and complex ActiveRecord queries. I enjoyed how there was no front end for the project. I believe having a SQL background helped me tremendously, otherwise I would have been lost.

#### Assessment
Graded by: Nate

Notes:
Good work
A great API tests for bad requests, and how the API responds to them
I think your SQL can be shorter, but not enough that I'm willing to put in the effort
Consistent indentation

### Self Directed Project
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dshinzie/mapchat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module3/projects/self_directed_project.md)

#### Description
I took this project as an opportunity to learn a new language, specifically NodeJS using the Express framework and MongoDB. It was a headache in the beginning and I thought I was making no headway, but within the last few days of the project I was able to get in the flow of writing JavaScript. I still don't like JavaScript though. Or MongoDB. But I really appreciate the fact that I was allowed to experiment with another technology.

I was not able to get as much done as I wish I could have, and much of it is probably due to the fact that I had very little idea of how to start.

## Feedback
### Rales Engine

"It was great working with Ryan on Rails Engine, which was possibly the most daunting project at Turing simply from reputation. We were able to coordinate without any struggle and finished the project early. Ryan's attention to detail and natural problem solving skills helped greatly when new issues were found, and his general oversight of the project helped us do a stellar job on all the assignments" - Me to Ryan

"I felt incredibly lucky to have Daniel as a partner for Rails Engine. I was nervous before the project, primarily because of its reputation and the complicated ActiveRecord and SQL queries necessary for completion. Daniel knows a lot about SQL, and he was an excellent teacher. It's not an exaggeration to say that I may not have been able to complete Rails Engine or my personal project, which requires many raw SQL queries, if I hadn't learned from Daniel. Beyond his patience as a teacher, Daniel was also an excellent partner for my work style. We discussed and distributed work efficiently and had a positive working environment throughout the project." - Ryan to Daniel

### Cloney Island
#### From Group
"Daniel was an awesome partner during Cloney Island.  He is always willing to put in the work necessary to have a successful project, and he takes the necessary risk to make a project highly successful.  His styling is so good - you’d think he was in the front-end program!  One opportunity for Daniel on future projects is to make sure he is taking breaks while he is working.  Overall, Daniel was a great partner and I look forward to working with him again" - Mike to Daniel

"Daniel is the type of programmer that goes all out trying to solve a problem.  He doesn’t give up, and it was great to work with him because of this attribute.  He is an active record and SQL boss, and I think the project would have taken much longer and we would have ran into more speed bumps if Dan had not been in our group." - Chase to Daniel

"It was great to work with Daniel on Cloney Island. He has an impressive work ethic that inspires me to work even harder. Daniel is really good at taking on risky, yet rewarding challenges. Adding the Google Maps functionality to the project was really cool. One area of growth for Daniel may be to take more breaks and ask others on the team specific questions related to the project to make sure they're keeping up." - Brad to Daniel

#### To Group
"Mike was a great partner to work with during Cloney Island. His natural project management vision helped us facilitate the project in a clear direction. Furthermore, Mike was willing to stay late during critical moments as well as split up work due to the breadth of the project. For future projects, Mike may be able to take on more front-end tasks. Regardless, Mike helped resolve many critical issues in various scopes that helped the project become successful." - Me to Mike

"Brad was a great partner to work with during Cloney Island. Brad was willing to take on tasks that he was uncomfortable with, but that we needed in order to complete the project. Brad taking on independent tasks was fundamental to the success of our project, and I greatly appreciate the fact that he did so. Brad also helped style some of the views, which was a stress-reliever as well. For future projects, I think Brad could try project management to force himself to bigger roles. Overall, Brad was a a pleasure to work with." - Me to Brad

"Chase was a great partner to work during Cloney Island. Chase definitely has an ability to think critically, and his knowledge of APIs and endpoints helped us move the project along at a quicker pace. Furthermore, Chase helped redirect several things we misunderstood during the project, such as how to use Twilio. For future projects, I think Chase could put in more effort in the final stages of the project, but overall I had a lot of fun working with him." - Me to Chase

## Posse Reflection
The Turing Lab posse was a great place to experiment. I think working with hardware would actually be really cool in the future. I found the guest speaker inspiring after he showed all the projects he worked on with physical equipment. However, that's probably way down the line.


## Professional Development

### Project Pitch
#### Map Chat

#### Pitch
This app is designed to increase communication for employees that constantly need directions to certain places.

#### Problem
Many employees, especially in work environments that are spread apart, move around constantly and may need to know where certain things are, such as cargo or a tool. Often an employee can tell them the general area, but won’t know exactly where it is. This app will allow employees to precisely relay locations to each and keep a stream of communication open.

#### Solution
This app is a chat system with an integrated map, where the user will be able to send addresses to each other. Users will be able to create new chatrooms and load new maps into each room, allowing each user to keep an open communication with various work sites. Users will be able to save spots, and send those spots to other users in the same chatroom, as well as message other users directly.

#### Target Audience
The target audience would be for employees in large work environments, such as construction, shipyards, etc.

#### Integrations (Back End Only)
I will be using the Google Maps API and Gmail OAuth integration

### Flower Exercise
#### Transferable Skills
I have skills in software and SQL development, general project management and client interaction.

#### Favorite/Most Valued Knowledge
I am able to debug issues with the mindset that it can be resolved.

#### Favorite working conditions
I would most want to work in an environment with minimal supervision, a hardworking atmosphere and without corporate politics

#### Favorite people to work with/serve
In the long run, I would like to create technology for 3rd world countries abroad. In the short run, I would like to work for renewable energy.

#### Values/Goals/Mission in life
Eventually, I would like to take my skills / knowledge in technology and helps those really in need outside of the US.

#### Preferred places to live
California, NY

#### Preferred salary and level of responsibility
Preferably starting 75K, with responsibility in all different areas

## Gear Up
#### Micro Aggression

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

This gear up was about micro-aggressions in the US. I personally found that some of the examples were not micro-aggressions ("Where are you from?"), and that some of the micro-aggressions were just examples of straight racism. Although I do think people should be aware of what they say, the examples in some of the articles could make people overly sensitive.

#### Journey Mapping

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This gear up was about mapping your journey, and how you tell your story to other people. People with similar / same experiences may have different sides to the story, and would emphasize different points in their journey.


#### Grit

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This gear up was about having a combination of persistence and passion, calling this duo "grit". The point was to emphasize that you should find something that lights your fire, where you are able to endure hardship due to your passion of the task at hand. It's hard to find this passion in tech sometimes since you debugging most of the time, but I would hope that eventually I find a tech that I am passionate about.
