# Will Ratterman - M2 Portfolio

-----------------------

## A: Personal Growth

### Areas of Emphasis

Attain proficiency in Ruby on Rails Development
Be more comfortable pursuing independent learning for programming related topics

### Areas of Growth

I felt that this mod was actually a pretty solid module for me. I felt independent with my learning, and most of my questions this module were more related to overall concepts and potential dev opportunities rather than dependency to understand the topic

-----------------------

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This mod was an interesting one from the project standpoint. With a large number being ungraded tutorials, it put the ball in our court to complete it. Ultimately, I thought my body of work through this module has demonstrated that I have a decent general understanding about the basics of Rails, ActiveRecord, and SQL.


#### Bike-Share

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/JF-Lalonde/bike-share/
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/bike-share

Description
```
In this project you'll use Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzes bike share usage in San Francisco.

ActiveRecord

Use ActiveRecord migrations to create a normalized database
Use intermediate ActiveRecord queries to calculate and report on information in the database
Utilize ActiveRecord methods and relationships to efficiently query the database
User Experience and Conventions

Use Sinatra and ERB templates to render views to create, read, update, and delete resources using RESTful routes and appropriate HTTP verbs
Use Sinatra and ERB templates to display a dashboard not related to a specific resource saved in the database
Use HTML and CSS to create a user experience that allows users to comfortably navigate a site
Code Organization/Quality

Organize code using best practices (use POROs when appropriate, avoid long methods, etc.)
Create methods using ActiveRecord on the appropriate class.
```

Goal: Since this was the first project we worked on in Mod 2, my goals were to understand the material in a way that I would be able to duplicate similar functionality at a later date. While the project was cool and it was nice playing around in Sinatra, the goal was definitely to identify the patterns of MVC and how that entire process works in an App. I definitely took a bit of a leadership role with the database for our project, which lent itself really well to the rest of the mod. Understanding DB relationships has been a strength of mine so far.


Reflection: Besides me having a Macbook Air and seeding taking 15+ hours I though it went okay as a group. There was definitely a spectrum of understanding of the material which I think tied up our pace a little big but at the end of the day, I think the people in our group could defend the code that we had written and had a pretty solid understanding of what we accomplished.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/wratterman/diet_foot_locker
* [Original Assignment] http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/mini-project

```
Individual Assignment for students to implement their own Rails App.
Either as a topic listed in the link above or their own.

Must-Haves:

Deploy to Heroku
Authentication/Authorization
One-to-many and Many-to-many relationships
Styling
Things to Consider

If you choose to do this option make sure you try to implement all the concepts we’ve touched over the last week. For example:

TDD - model and feature tests
CRUD
1-1 and 1-many relationships
ReST-ful routes
Well structured relational database design
Rails helpers
Sessions, flashes and maybe cookies if you have a good use case for them.
Authentication
Authorization
```

Goal: Build out a fully functional app with the ability to create and account with a session, determine additional Authorization based on role, create one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, build a simulation for a site that may exist in the real world.

Reflection: This was a big moment for me, as this is where I realized I feel pretty comfortable using Rails. I could see the steps from the migration level that I needed to take to implement specific functionality pieces and be familiar with implementing them. I could have spent more time developing the views portion of my app or using factory girl in testing, but both of those seemed non-essential for this mod and something that I could get more exposure to over the break.

#### Little Shop

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/jtruong2/little_shop
* [Original Assignment]http://backend.turing.io/module2/projects/little_shop

```
In this project you’ll use Ruby on Rails to build an online commerce platform to facilitate online ordering.

Use TDD to drive all layers of Rails development including unit and integration tests
Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
Practice mixing HTML, CSS, and templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface
Differentiate responsibilities between components of the Rails stack
Write an articulate README documenting features and functionalities of application
Deploy an application to Heroku
Build a logical user-flow that moves across multiple controllers and models
Practice an agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team
```
Goal: Finish off the mod strong with a well done project. Become more familiar with the breaking up of workload and being able to work separately, reconvene and merge our work together. Demonstrate my knowledge of Rails, ActiveRecord, DB relationships, and MVC.

Reflection: My experience with this project has been great. I really like the group that I was in. We were all capable of keeping up with each other's thoughts. We were all able to vocalize our ideas and implement them into the code. We were able to split up work and merge together again without (many) merge conflicts. Ultimately, I feel really good about Little Shop.

## C: Final Assessments

### Timed:

  #### 1. Workflow
    * 4: Developer consistently breaks complex problems into small steps with logical sequence that is evident from git history

  #### 2. Feature Completeness
    * 3: Developer is able to implement all functionality and all tests pass

  #### 3. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style
    * 4: Developer consistently establishes and utilizes ActiveRecord methods for effective and efficient results

  #### 4. Rails Style / MVC
    * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

  #### 5. Testing
    * 4: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development effectively

Written:
  #### Comprehension:
    *   4: Developer demonstrates abundant comprehension of all concepts covered

  #### Technical Communication
    *   4: Developer’s responses are exceptionally clear and complete


Was this a representation of your best work?
- Pretty much

## D: Module Outcomes

I had a really good experience this mod. So far, that makes 2/2 at Turing.
The instructors are great, Lauren and Mike (Rachel too!) did an awesome job in my opinion. Mod2 was a really nice balance of independence and dependency to the instructors, but I definitely felt it did a good job preparing me with what I need to know about Rails and giving some resources for independent investigation.

Two Thumbs Up!
