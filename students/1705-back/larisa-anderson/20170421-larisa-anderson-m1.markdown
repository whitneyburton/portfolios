# LARISA ANDERSON - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
Finding my balance. Balance I feel is a struggle for most throughout life. I knew before coming to Turing I would need to let go of feeling the need to DO everything. This is MY TIME. I gained so much perpective when learning about "Growth Mindset", it helped me tremendously. I feel that at the end of Mod 1 I finally began to trust myself. You are smart, you CAN do this. The tools at Turing are amazing, the support is unparrelled to anything else I have ever been apart of. That being said, the tools to learn Ruby have been great. Learning and implementing TDD has not only helped my understanding of Ruby basics, but has come up in other areas of my life where I need to take a step back approach and ask those importnant questions to get the answers I need.

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Chantal Justamond):

**Feedback for _Chantal_Justamond:**

When I found out I was paired with Chantal, I felt a wave of relief sweep over my body. How lucky was I to be paired with such
and understanding, smart, and friendly person.
We made our DTR, and we both knew that because of my lack of experince it was going to be a tough project to both feel that
we we're going to be able to contribute equally.

We started out working together, and we decided that we were going to divide and concour. Looking back I feel that this wasn't
the best way to start our project. Reason being is I needed to be able to see the ins and outs of the code to help me
understand the problem.
I started to work on the project with Dave Maurer, and invited Chantal to work with us. We decided that we should stop moving
forward until I was able to catch up. I am not sure if this was the best idea for the project, but it made sense at the time.

Chantal,
I really appreciated your work on the project. You were very commited to finding the answer to the problems. I know that this
dedication to coding will take you far. You also have a great gift in pateince, and believe me I know all about patience.
Had you been a partner that wasn't able to take a step back and genuinly
care that I was apart of the project it would have turned out badly for us both.

**Feedback from ____Chantal Jsutamond:**

During the week of our pairing project I saw how invested you are in learning and even though you say it's not clicking believe me it is, Your brain is doing the job in the background, one of this days you will have that elusive AHAA!! moment that we all love. Also I would like to add that maybe for your next time, take into consideration the type of person your partner is, since you are an extrovert and I'm an introvert I felt pressured to work in your style instead of the way that works the best for me. I do have say that when we divided our tasks, me the key-maker , Larisa the Offset generator, you did a wonderful job reaching out to the right people and fulfilled the job in timely manner, communication is also one of your strengths to be proud of. Lastly, I would like to add that I'm very proud of your performance during our evaluation, it showed how much you've learned.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: __3/17/2017_________

I grew up with a wicked smart little sister.. like 5 years younger little sister. She has her masters degree in international politics at the young age of 22... She was helping me with my math homework when she was in grade school. I developed a toxic thought that I wasn't smart, that I wasn't good at math and there it started my battle of my truth and the truth, which unfortunately can become one and the same. So because of this learning was only in the arts, creative writing, and acting. So this session was so useful for me. I am very fortunate to be apart of Turing.

#### Session 2: __3/22/2017_________

I feel like the support and full disclosure and the genuine vibe at Turing has made a large impact on my stress levels. Don't get me wrong. Im stressed out, but I feel like it will be okay. There is LIGHT at the end of the storm.

#### Session 3: ____3/31/2017__________

I feel I am the middle of the road in this area. I come off as very outgoing but I NEED to have my alone time to process how much energy I've given and recieved. I am very aware of my presence and I am able to see when and where I need to tone it down or tune it up.

#### Session 4: ______4/05/2017_______

The sense of community brought me to Turing- My leses being a mom has me looking at the world a little differently. Being a woman ame me feel like I have so much power but I also feel powerless.

#### Session 5: _____4/14/2017___________

When I tell peole what I am doing they look very surpized and ask if I like it? I say yes and they nod in agreement and say good for you. I haven't recieved any negative feedback from anyone. Well.. Only myself. Only myself telling myself that I am not smart enough and I should be doing better. After the video I felt very inspried to do more, talk more and learn more. I also felt inspired because of my daughter.

### Community Participation

I feel like I have made effort to get to know people, I know that I make people feel welcome and have heard from my peers that they really appreicated me giving them that energy.
