>* This was my favorite mod. I felt like I did well and learned a ton of useful knowledge that I will carry with me.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* I thought this was a great project and a certaintly something that I referenced throughout the mod.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* This was a fun project to work on. I thought it was incredibly helpful in learning and understand active record. The lesson Josh gave prior to this project was essential to my understanding and ability to exceed in this project.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* This was the most fun I have had on project while at Turing. It was probably one of the most challenging as well. We had a really great group of coders. The freedom of the project allowd us to push the limits of our understanding and do something completely new. In that process I learned a lot.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* This project seemed like great practice for the real world. It was nice to come into a project with the bare bones already built out, and go through a different process of adding features on.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I made myself available to mod 2 and mod 1 students for help with their projects.(At least the ones I was comfortable with) I also tried to help as best I could in our own mod. I helped move a friend as well.
