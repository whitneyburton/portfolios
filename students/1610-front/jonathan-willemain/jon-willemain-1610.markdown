## Areas of Emphasis

During my first module at Turing I was really worried about Javascript and being vocal about the direction I was taking to solve that problem. I still need to work on being more vocal and not as nervous when it comes to thinking through a problem with a partner.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Mythical Creatures

* [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/jonwille/Mythical-Creatures)
* [Original Assignment]
(https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript-foundations)

Can you complete implementations of each of the creatures without using if statements? Think about how removing them affects your code.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We completed four projects during our first module at Turing. They include Game-time, IdeaBox, Linked List and Number-guesser.

#### Game-time

# https://github.com/jonwille/Frogger
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

##Functional Expectations

3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs

##User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.

## JavaScript Style
3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.


## Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

#### IdeaBox

# https://github.com/noahpeden/idea-box
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

## Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

## Workflow

3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

## Collaboration

2.5 - paired in person, didn't communicate through GH because they were pairing together. Missed opportunity to practice GH workflow.

#### Linked-List

# https://github.com/jonwille/linkList
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

## Functional Expectations

2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One.

## Fundamental JavaScript Style

2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

## Workflow

2.8: The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.


## HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

## CSS Style

2: Your application has some duplication and minor bugs. Developer can speak to most choices made in the code and knows what every line is doing.

#### Linked-List

# https://github.com/jonwille/Number-Guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

## Notes

There wasn't a ton of JavaScript completed, but what was there was relatively clean
Variable names should be more descriptive
Styling was missing some major details from the comp, e.g. the buttons were switched around
Rubric

## UX/UI Expectations

2: Application meets the basic spirit of the comp but overlooks many details. Extensions show questionable design decisions that negatively impact the overall UX/UI.

## Functional Expectations

2: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase One

## Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote You Conscience

* [GitHub URL]
(https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

From this article we see how right and responsibilities go hand and hand, we see how we can take our rights but not the responsibilities that come with them. When reading the article I was thinking of something much smaller than voting, I was thinking how we have a 'right' to get a drivers license. Most of us use this right, but when it comes to the responsibilities we owe our fellow citizens of not texting while driving we disregard that responsibility.

When asked the question, "Describe your attitude toward voting and participating in the US electoral system." I have always thought we should all vote. The reason I believe everyone should vote is because the population will balance itself out. I don't think the two-party system is best for this idea. We are going to have extremes on both sides canceling each other out, we need to figure out a way to get the median of those extremes.

#### Resilience
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I am really excited to see that we were talking about resilience during today's gear-up. I thought the things we went through and how we handled them as a child defined our resilience. It was very interesting hearing Joshua Spodek's take on resilience. I never thought about resilience as a thought process. Not knowing resilience as something we can work on and improve. With this new take on resilience, I plan on working on that muscle and try to become a more resilient individual.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Noah Peden:
I had a great time working with you on idea- box, "a box for your ideas. " I like how you took charge on the html so we could get right to work on our javascript. We needed that extra day, considering we were at Gusto until 12:30 the night before it was due. I think we struggled with local storage, but that was expected. It was definitely fun working with you!

To Breana Knight:
It was an absolute pleasure working with you on number-guesser. I appreciate you helping me with the css, I felt like that is my weakness and you stepped up. Us not being able to use git and github definitely made the project harder for us. I also liked that you were willing to get pairing sessions with me as well. Overall I think we work really well together and hope we can work together on a future project!

### Being a Community Member
Adam Rice:
During the Game Time project I was paired with Jon and was very excited when I learned this. Jon and I were already friends before pairing. Jon is a smart guy and willing to work hard on problems that arise. I feel that Jon could be better at talking through a problem when pairing, as often we would be looking at code trying to resolve a problem and Jon would be very silent. Also, there was a day that Jon and I were scheduled to meet and Jon failed to show up on time, did not answer my calls, then called me two hours later and claimed he had fallen asleep. Jon perhaps could have thought ahead in this situation and set an alarm. Jon is good at staying relaxed in stressful and trying situations.

Noah Peden:
Wow, that was a difficult project. I think localStorage really prooved to be be one of the biggest struggles for the both of us and I am very grateful that you were willing to re-write our entire JS file until 1am the night before our Eval. I am also grateful for you taking charge on CSS and your portion of the jQuery when you stepped back to try and get a better handle on it. I don't really have any constructive criticism since you and I both struggled in the same places and the light flickered on at the same time. Maybe next time (and this goes for me too), just research what the main thing is going to be, and be more willing to start from scratch if something isn't working. Cause as Jeff says, our code ain't worth shit.

Kenia Farias:
Overall I think our project went well, but I do think we could have done better.
I think we did a really good job at working as a group through the project and even though we had problems with git Hub we figured it out! One thing that I think you could work on is being more verbal while working in a group. There were times where I felt like you needed to be more assertive with your ideas for the project. Overall I think we worked well and even though we still have
room for growth I was happy with our project. --Kenia Farias :)

Breana Knight:
The work that you did was much appreciated. We were able to scrape together at the end to get what we needed. Number guesser was our first project and because of that there were a number of ambiguities with our knowledge and facts of the project. It wasn’t ideal but I thought it was a great that we had these discrepancies as I think they will be very helpful with organizing and planning future projects. We had some setbacks, but you had a good attitude, and we  got it done. I enjoyed working with you.

### Playing a Part

Once I graduate from Turing, I plan to reach out to local clubs with the intent to volunteer my services in creating or expanding youth technology programs. As a representative of the Hispanic community, I would be very proud to serve as an example to younger generations to show that under-represented classes are not only capable of success in any arena, but also can enrich their surroundings with their values and perspective. I am also looking for a company that shares the same values.
