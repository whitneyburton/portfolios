We got a 3.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### BYOB

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/apsitos/HappyHourAPI)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/build-your-own-backend.html)

This project was a individual project to experience building a back end. I initially had some trouble with testing, but it turns out I just need a little time away from the project to figure out what the issues were.

Feedback to me: 
Working with anna was a real joy. We worked together on JetFuel and I had absolutely no idea what was going on. She was the real MVP. She was patient with me when i was slow to understand what was going on when building an api. She works incredibly hard and has become a very strong developer. Thanks for being patient with me Anna. I'm sorry It took until after the project was due to really start to understand node. You're awesome! - Mike Z

#### Imposter Syndrome

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/StephanieEA/savery)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/apsitos/HappyHourAPI)

This was our Electron app. Steph, Gabi, and I attempted to build a desktop app that would keep track of online recipes, allow the user to keep a running grocery list, and set a timer for cooking times.

Feedback to me:

I felt that working on Savery with you was the most well-organized project that I've worked on this module despite working with an unfamiliar framework. You did a great job at owning the data storage object, and we all were able to work through the confusing process of storing data. Overall I found our workflow to be very cohesive. For the most part, tasks seemed to be evenly divided and we took the time to do stand-ups to get the status of each task and to plan our goals. - Gabi Procell

It was awesome to work with you in Mod4 after last having worked together in mod1- We have come so far! I know you had some reservations about taking on a divide and conquer approach and I was impressed with how gracefully you managed tackling the more challenging aspects of this projects development. It was also interesting to see how we work at different speeds and I’m really grateful for you being patient w/me in the pairing process. Our git communication/pr’s were the best I’ve taken part in yet and I really value your ability to communicate on and offline. Rock on!!! Thanks for being an awesome team member! - Steph Andrews

Community feedback:

As a whole, we did an amazing job knowing what needed to be worked on in pairs and what needed to be broken out into individual tasks. We kept our workflow sane (for the most part) and didn’t really have any major issues until the last day. Elijah definitely took the lead in terms of staying on track and making sure people had things to work on. Anna and Gabi did an amazing job working on wireframes in the first day to make sure we all knew what we would need to build out first and what was most important. Elijah, you, Bekah and I worked on reformatting your database that first day and it was really awesome to be able to work through your code with you. We all had a hand in every part of the project, which was super awesome to see. Bekah, you took the lead on forms which a huge thing to tackle and it looks and functions so well! It was really awesome that we all met at Thump on Saturday and just sat and worked separately but together on all our stuff. That day was huge and the project really started coming together. I’m super proud of our capstone and hope that it’s a thing that will live on 4evah. - Devin Beliveau

We did a great job in the beginning of the project with communicating as a group on how we wanted our UX/UI to look. From that point, we started to assign tasks to others and pair or work individually. After the first few days, I feel that we suffered from not doing a DTR session or appointing a PM. Some of the tasks were bundled together, making it hard to break things into smaller components for others to work on. While I was struggling with some portions, I did appreciate Elijah, Devin, or Anna pairing with me to help figure out some issues. In hindsight, I wish that we had been able to plan better and assign tasks in a more efficient manner. I feel like I got swept into the role of picking up small tasks, which is still valuable. Perhaps involving everyone in the API planning at some point would have made everyone feel included on all aspects of the project. At the same time, we were working on a huge project with a tight deadline which left little time to catch everyone up on everything. This was a large project with a large group, and there were bound to be some conflicts, but I do appreciate our time together. - Gabi Procell

I think our capstone group was awesome. Like a couple of us have already said, it would have been best to DTR, assign a PM, and stick with waffle. I think our product turned out great but we could have worked a bit more on our organization. Overall awesome job to everyone, I don’t think we could have done it without everyone’s 100% effort! We rock. -Bekah Lundy

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Automation

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/pull/25)

Planning and leading the final Gear Up of the mod was a good experience. I knew that Beth did a lot of work to set up each session, but having to rework one really drove the point home. I also enjoyed moderating one of the smaller groups during the discussion.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

Led final mod Gear Up on Automation with three other Mod 4 students. Paired with Breana Knight once or twice to help her with React.
