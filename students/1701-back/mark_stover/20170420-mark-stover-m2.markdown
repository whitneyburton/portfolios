> This module was hard for me in a very different way than Module 1. There was much less algorithmic thinking and much more focus on process and memorization. This was challenging for me because the work was focused less on finding a solution, and more and getting through the many necessary steps required to complete a project.

-----------------------

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

| Category | Score (optional) |
| ----- | --- |
| **Pairing Assessment** | PASS |
| **Written Diagnostic** | PASS |

> I am becoming more comfortable at working through problems with instructors.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [VIM](https://medium.com/@stovermc/to-vim-or-not-to-vim-76d406fddb5b)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> These projects were very helpful in providing exposure to topics that were later covered in lecture. Because they were so lengthy, I had to make sure I was using pomodoros in order to give each part of the tutorials my full attention. These projects also proved to be useful resources to come back to for clarification throughout the module and during other projects.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> Job tracker provided the same type of learning for me as Blogger and Mix Master. It was helpful in introducing me to new concepts that were later covered in lecture. The Rails Mini Project was great in that it really helped reinforce all of my learning this Module. It was also a really nice break from tutorial work. Because I was able choose my own project, I noticed an increase in my enthusiasm and productivity.


## C: Group Work & Projects

> **Bike Share**
>* In this project we used Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site that analyzed bike share usage in San Francisco
>* This project was a great introduction to working on a larger team. It required us to improve upon our Git skills in order to keep our work flow organized and helped to highlight the value of good team communication. The was my first time using Activerecord and I enjoyed finding ways to leverage database relationships to procure the required information.

> **Little Shop of Orders**
>* In this project we used Ruby, Rails, and Activerecord to build an online store complete with shopping cart, authentication, and authorization.
>* This project was really enjoyable. We strived to use agile methodologies to drive the completion of our MVP. We communicated really well and were able to successfully implement all of the logic required to implement all of the features of our site. Additionally, our testing suite was rock solid and our site developed using 100% TDD.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Natalie Barron: Mark, it was a pleasure working with you on Bike Share. I appreciated your commitment to learning and understanding. Our approach to completing iteration 1 together really helped my understanding of ActiveRecord fundamentals. Although we ultimately used the gem, I was impressed with your dedication to understanding pagination. Your positive attitude helped get us through the project and I’m proud of our completed project.

  >* From Erin Bassity: I really enjoyed working on a team with you. Your interpersonal skills are great, and you are equally skilled in team-based work and solo work. You delivered, you showed up, you talked through problems, you were there for your team the entire time. You wrote great code, you refactored, you kept your eye on the ball, you were creative and advocated well for things you felt we should try when we were stuck, and you kept a positive attitude throughout. Thank you for an excellent team experience all around!

##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Natalie Barron: Mark, it was a pleasure working with you on Little Shop. You did a great job implementing the cart functionality. I was really impressed. I really appreciated the pairing we did throughout the project. Working with you has been a great experience. You are very knowledgeable and dedicated to really understanding what's going on. I've learned so much from working with you on both Bike Share and Little Shop. Thanks for being a great teammate!
  >* From Erin Bassity: It was awesome getting to work on a second project with you. Again, your styling wizardry gave our site an awesome professional appearance, unrivaled by any other little shop projects in my opinion. Nice Job! You seemed much more comfortable as project manager this time around and I think our project is an expression of this. Your set up of Trello was the backbone of our workflow and the daily stand ups and retros you facilitated contributed to our awesome group dynamic. Lastly, I saw great improvement in your technical skills this project. I think the questions you asked were awesome, the hard work you put in was inspiring, and the smile you brought every day helped contribute to our awesome group dynamic. Thanks for providing a wonderful team experience!
  >* From Stephanie Bentley:Team:  You guys rocked! I had a lot of fun working on this project and building our site.  I’m really proud of our hard work and that we were able to accomplish all of the goals we set in our DTR.  It was such a nice feeling to be working on nothing but extensions the last few days of the project- definitely a refreshing change from previous project experiences! I think our success was the result of the really strong communication.  We were all on the same page for daily goals and overall work-structure. The Trello cards were great and much cleaner/easier than waffle.io. I’m glad we made this switch early in the project. I also think we worked really well as a team. We shared responsibility well and accomplished quite a bit individually, in pairs, and all together. I’m also really proud of our TDD-ing. This was something we all mentioned wanting to improve upon in the DTR, and I feel like we stuck to that goal and pushed ourselves to write tests before ever writing code.  I definitely feel stronger as a result. Thanks for a great end-of-mod project.
Mark: I know you asked for “critical feedback”, but I’m having a hard time coming up with anything.  I really appreciated your work ethic, your willingness to get things done on this project, and your calm approach to tackling difficult problems. This was especially helpful for me as someone who can get anxious and stressed out quickly. It was awesome the way you built out the cart functionality and then took the time to explain what was going on with the code you wrote to the rest of us. I also learned how to set and pass in new params because of the work we did with the “checkout” button and creating an order. Thanks!

## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/mark_stover.md)

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
I think that empathy is one of the most powerful communication tools available to us as humans. In the scope of privilege, I feel that empathy provides a channel of communication that can transcend peoples differing backgrounds. Inevitably, people have different experiences and different backgrounds but through empathy we can understand and relate to one another. To me, empathy occurs on an emotional level, and because of this, I am able to better understand the experiences of another. Although someones experience may be very different from mine, I can relate to, and understand the emotional impact a particular experience may have. An example of this could be financial stress. I believe that financial stress exists across the full spectrum of wealth distribution. Someone struggling to pay rent may feel the same financial stress as someone struggling to make a mortgage payment on a million dollar house. Because the feeling is similar, I believe the two people in question could empathetically relate to each other through based on their emotional responses to their respective situations. In this way, barriers built by differing experiences and life situations can be transcended through emotional and empathetic understanding.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
In an environment like Turing, having Grit is essential. To me, this means having the mental capacity to continue to work, and work well, through failures, through long days/weeks/months of performing at 100% capacity. This capacity comes from passion and enjoyment of the work we are doing here. It also comes from knowing when to take a break. When the going gets tough, and it feels like progress in futile, remembering what I enjoy about programming is one way that I am able to apply my grit and continue working. If I did not have the passion or find joy in the work that I am doing at Turing, I do not think that I would be able to apply my whole self in the way that I do. It is also important for me to recognize when my grit is wearing thin and to respect this acknowledgement and take a break for awhile. This may seem a bit counter intuitive, but being mindful of this will help me continue to apply my grit in the long run. Turing is a marathon, not a sprint.

> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
When I think about automation, I find that I have two different perspectives. First, at a high level, I think automation is a great thing. I believe that we have really large systemic problems in the world, ie. over-population, poverty, extreme inequalities in distribution of wealth, etc., and I think that automation will further highlight these issues and force us to develop solutions to them. At a granular level, I still believe automation is a good thing, but lots of work needs to be done in order to prepare for the effects it will have on our economies and ways of life. I think we will find the best solutions through having an opinion and discussing it with others, determining what course of action will provide the least amount of suffering amongst all people. Unfortunately, regardless of how much we prepare for automation, I feel there will be a period of time defined by the suffering that automation will create until we have things in place, such as basic income, that will allow us to continue to live prosperously.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

#### **Giving Feedback**

##### Feedback from me for Bike Share

  >* For Natalie Barron: It am grateful that  we were on the same team on Bike Share. You consistently produced quality work which gave me confidence in our dividing and conquering techniques. You also are very skilled at talking through a difficult coding challenges, helping to identify the root of the problem. For me this was really helpful at the beginning of the project as we worked our way through the CRUD functionality. Lastly, it is apparent you have a strong handle on the Ruby language. This makes working through challenging problems, ie iteration 6 and on up, really fun. I really enjoyed our driver/navigator roles as we worked towards wrapping up our project. I find coding to be the most fun when the majority of brain power is working towards solving a logic problem, and is not distracted by syntactical or tool malfunctions. I think we found that headspace at the end.. even though we were turning into robots! All in all, this was one of the best pairing experiences I have had. Thanks for being a great teammate!
  >* For Erin Bassity: I sure am glad you were our team lead. Your organizational skills really helped to drive our project and gave it a really nice tempo. I always knew what to be working on and that was in large part due to the tools you set up for us at the beginning of our project. You did a wonderful job in facilitating discussion around our project design, timelines/daily expectations, and sticking points. In the case of styling our website, your obvious skill in HTML really gave our site a professional touch. You also did a great job of communicating exactly how you were styling our site, keeping each of us up to speed on your work. All together it made for a very positive team experience!

##### Feedback from me for Little Shop


  >* For \<Natalie Barron>: Natalie: It was great getting to work with you on another project. I really like the way you work through problems and appreciate the way you are able to calmly work through each error in order to arrive at a solution. I feel we used TDD really well on this project and think that is in large part because of the way you pushed for it in our DTR. It has taught me the true value of TDD and is something that I will take with me to future projects. Your open communication around study time was very helpful in prioritizing our time spent as a group and consequently, we made an awesome app together. Also, the levity you and your robot voice bring to the group is nothing short of wonderful. It was a pleasure working with you on Tripvontrapp!
  >* For \<Partner>:Stephanie: I am glad we were finally able to work on a project together! You added a dynamic to our group that we were lacking and because of it, we performed at a much higher level. You gave 100% every day and really helped drive our project to completion. This included making the decision to start working as a team to ensure we were all capturing the learning this project offered. Your technical skills are really strong and I enjoyed working through the creation of orders and the checkout process with you. I noticed you are working on your keyboard shortcuts in Atom, thats awesome! I think if you gave VIM an honest effort you would really like it. Overall, you are a wonderful teammate and I would be thrilled to work on a future project with you.
  >* For \<Partner 3>: Erin: It was awesome getting to work on a second project with you. Again, your styling wizardry gave our site an awesome professional appearance, unrivaled by any other little shop projects in my opinion. Nice Job! You seemed much more comfortable as project manager this time around and I think our project is an expression of this. Your set up of Trello was the backbone of our workflow and the daily stand ups and retros you facilitated contributed to our awesome group dynamic. Lastly, I saw great improvement in your technical skills this project. I think the questions you asked were awesome, the hard work you put in was inspiring, and the smile you brought every day helped contribute to our awesome group dynamic. Many thanks!


#### **Posse**
  >* This module I have been a part of Turing labs. We have been working on building an arcade box that will host Turing's arcade on a raspberry pi.
  >* Thus far, my favorite thing has been building out the arcade box and assembling the monitor, joysticks, and buttons. It has been really cool to see it all come together.
  >* My posse experience has helped me better understand what hardware is and how it can be implemented. By playing around with the raspberry pi I have learned a lot about what a computer is in its simplest form.

#### **Playing a Part**

> As an SAB representative for our cohort I feel that I have helped play a part in making sure our classroom is a place of inclusion and respect. I have also paired with various module 1 students and participated in lunch roulette. Additionally, I high five nearly every one I make eye contact with. It's awesome.
