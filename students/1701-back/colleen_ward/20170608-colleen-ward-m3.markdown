## Areas of Emphasis

> During mod 3 I wanted to get more practice with complex database queries, learn how to build and consume APIs and push myself to take on new challenges.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
>* APIcurious focused on consuming and working with data from a public API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website’s existing UI using their own API (Github).
>* I really enjoyed APIcurious and really pushed myself to try some of the extensions. It was a great project to learn how to work with someone else's API and how to manipulate the JSON into something you could work with for your own application.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* This project used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.
>* I did not enjoy Rales Engine at first, because it was very repetitive, but once we started to get into the more complex business intelligence queries I really started to enjoy the project. I thought it was a really good project to get practice with ActiveRecord/SQL.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://)**
>* This project built a new platform from scratch to handle multiple types of users (guests, registered users & admins) based on an existing web application (Airbnb). During week 2 team members selected a complex user story to focus on.
>* I really enjoyed the first sprint of Cloney Island. We obviously had a great all-female team that kicked- butt and delivered a great project. My user story to build out API endpoints was somewhat challenging.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://)**
>* Sprint 2 built off of the first with team members again selecting their own user story to focus on, some people switched teams and had the opportunity to work on "brownfield" code.
>* The second sprint of Cloney Island was enjoyable - I would have preferred getting some experience working on a brownfield project rather than staying with the same one. Since we already had a pretty solid product to work with we each focused pretty much on our individual user stories. My story to add an analytics dashboard was really challenging but I really enjoyed it and feel I learned a lot from it.

## C: Professional Skills


#### **Gear Ups**

> [Microagressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
I thought the microagressions gear up was really valuable. As someone who has experienced microagressions in the workplace on a regular basis, it was helpful for me to share my experiences and give examples of what happens too often for many women. I think talking about them with the cohort helped us all realize that we probably have all said something that we didn't realize was a microagression and helps us think twice next time.

> [Tragedy of the Commons](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)
Tragedy of the commons was probably one of my favorite gear ups so far. I thought the website that helped explain was incredibly powerful. Talking in small groups about it was also really powerful because some of us had differing opinions and we were able to discuss those in a safe conversation.

> [Choose your own adventure](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/)
I attended the Lending your Privilege during this gear up. I really enjoyed the videos that were presented - they were good examples of how many of us don't realize that we do have some kind of privilege. The small group discussion was also a really great part as we were again able to discuss our thoughts in a small group.


## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* https://caward12.github.io/javascript.html


#### **Posse**
  >* I worked with the Hamilton posse on the wellness tracker.
  >* Mod 3 did not allow us a ton of time to work on this project but we are pretty close to having it completed - at least MVP. We implemented Oauth with Github and I worked on the admin functionality.
  >* I think the wellness tracker, once completed, will be a great thing to add to my resume as an actual application being used (hopefully) by real users.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I try to attend Joan Clark meetings on Tuesdays and I started attending Imposters lunch on Wednesdays.
