# Juan Diego Jimenez - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Overall, my main goal was to get better at public speaking, do a side project, learn React, outreach a mentor, and get better at ES6.

* On the technical side, I wanted to get a solid understanding of algorithms, ES6, and React. I was able to accomplish these goals by self studying React; practicing algorithms with my classmates, and by the excellent feedback from the instructors.

* On the professional part, I wanted to get better at public speaking, and outreach a mentor. I was able to practice public speaking by giving a workshop about React to my classmates. This experience went great and I want to do it again. I got better at networking and was able to outreach a mentor, which helped me a lot in my personal project.

In future mods I want to :
1. Improve in public speaking by doing at least one lightning talks in class and volunteer to do one in wrap up.
2. Start a blog of my story and get more visibility to build credibility in the developer community.
3. Finish my side project.
4. Start a new side project.
5. Outreach more mentors.
6. Give a spike.

### Comments:
* quickSort is so pretty
* remove comments from code as a general rule of thumb (unless it's absolutely necessary to understand what the code is doing)
* testing: think about sad paths, would like a test for an empty array since you took time to write the logic in the function
* Overall GREAT project!!!

#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

4: Application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or no duplication and all components separated out into logical components. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.


#### 2. Test-Driven Development

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration. Arrays of random numbers and letters are generated to test the maximum number of elements which the algorithm can sort.

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility


#### 4. Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

-----------------------

### Comments:
* Testing had some confusing logic set to variables, strive towards making tests extremely readable and straightforward
* That said, the logic I saw in your tests showed a great understanding of the array prototypes and es6
* Suggest is long, room for refactor...but it works! So good job
* Great use of es6 and recursion

#### 1. Fundamental JavaScript & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of JavaScript syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.

#### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

* 4 - Zero complaints

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

I worked on 2 group projects this mod:

* Game Time
* Weathrly

For game time we used javascript and html canvas to create a clone of the game Tron. We also started using a TDD approach. For weathrly we used React, ES6, and api calls to make a weather app website. We used JEST and enzyme for TDD.

-----------------------

## Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jdiejim/Tron)

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

#### Empathy

Emily did a great job presenting the topic and telling us her experience. This session really opened my eyes about social norms and feelings of being left out. Now I feel more aware of social norms, and also believe that we have to make an effort to be the difference and spread awareness in the workplace, especially in the tech industry.

#### Parable of the Polygons

During this gear up we played an online game that showed us how diversity can reduce segregation in a community. By demanding a little bit of diversity, and changing the perception of what is acceptable in an environment, the community reduces segregation. Creating equality takes effort, but it brings more value to a society.

#### Knowledge

During this session we discussed what knowledge is, and how to approach it in a philosophical way. I learned that philosophy and programming mix well. They both deal with logic and solving abstractions. One of my main takeaways from this session is the idea of self. What is the self? What makes us unique? What makes us conscious?

-----------------------

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

One of my goals that I set last mod was to be more involved in the Turing community. To accomplish this I did the following:

* Paired with Mod 1 students
* Started a personal project to make a web app that facilitates the scheduling of parings between students
* Joined the Pahlka Posse and helped build a web app that mapped food deserts in Denver CO
* Gave a React workshop to my classmates where we build a pokedex
* Participated in the productivity lunch group where we discussed strategies/routines/habits to improve our productivity in life, during Turing, and after Turing.

-----------------------

#### Posse

The goal of the posse this mod was to:
* create an interactive map of food stores in Denver and the assets in communities that could be activated for food distribution particularly in the summer time for youth.

I contributed by building the web comp and navigation bar.

#### Paring Feedback

###### from: Shayla R. Richard

> “I thoroughly enjoyed my opportunity to pair with Juan this inning. Juan has a great way of explaining complex concepts in a way that are easy to absorb. He uses the whiteboard to produce visuals that make working through problems easy.  I appreciate his willingness to help, his openness, and encouragement along the way. I tease him that he's a genius, which is true, however he is a great friend, and addition to the Turing community.”

###### from: Erik Ingvalson

> “Thanks for all your help today w/ our Linked List project. It was difficult for us to try and wrap our heads around how we could input the user input into our div's, but you made it very clear. You also showed us how to make our code much more concise and easier to read. Thanks so much!”

###### from: Dan Alvarez

> “Dear Juan, you were very helpful in explaining what we were doing wrong in jQuery as well as pointing out ways to solve the problem. Once we were shown the resource that would give us what we wanted, you walked us through examples that made the understanding of the concepts clear. You were clear in your explanations and helpful showing us concepts we were not taught in class but we will be using in the future. Thank you so much.- Dan and Erik FE Mod1”

> “Juan! Gracias otra vez! Yo olvido a escribir 'feedback' por la ayuda. Como siempre, fuiste muy helpful con todos mis problemas. No solo diga me que nessicito hacer, perro tambien me aprendes como hacer soluciones a mis problemas. Entonces gracias otra vez. Y nessicito te comprar una cerveza o algo parra decir gracias. Hasta luego! -Dan Alvarez. Y tambien lo siento si mi espanol es horrible... chao!”
