# (Sage Vogt) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I came into turing front-end mod one with limited CSS experience. I came seeking good practice
methods and healthy study habits. I wanted to be a devoted student and learn as much as I could 
during my time as a mod 1 student, so that I would be prepared to level up when the time came. 
I was determined to follow the advice of others around me in regards to good practice and healthy
turing habits.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/SageVanGogt/numberGuesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser was my first attempt at incorporating JS, CSS, and HTML in one project. The opportunity to work individually with JS before entering the pairing stage was valuable. It forced me to struggle just enough that I would be able to comprehend JS foundations.

##### Personal Feedback from partner (Ryan Harrington)
We worked very well together and built a great project. I admire your willingness and ability to jump into
 the unknown in order to go the extra mile, for example the user feedback modal you implemented really
  quickly. We’re both pretty strong willed, and definitely butted heads a bit on how exactly we wanted to
   do certain things such as: some naming and the read bookmark count tabs vs fraction approach. I still 
   have no idea why you hate fractions so much. This is something to keep in mind in case you have a more
    agreeable partner who goes with the flow more. However, I think this shared characteristic made the 
    project more like writing real world production code because other people will always think their 
    method is better also and we’ll need to persuade the other person of our methods merit or use the other 
    persons method. We both gained more from debating how we wanted to do certain things. If you hadn’t
     taken that hard stand on BEM and just agreed to my misinterpretation of BEM, our project would have
      been worse and I wouldn’t have learned the right way.”

#### Idea Box

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

##### Evaluator: Pamela

##### Comments: Be sure that both partners touch all areas of the project

##### Scores: 

### DESIGN/COMP
- Responsive hold up pretty well across screen sizes
- Comp recreation is pretty good

### HTML
- Add aria-label to inputs and form around search input
- Ran it through a screenreader!!!

### CSS
- Nice organzation of files
- Declarations organized alphabetically - consider idiomatic organization for other projects
- Nice job using one media query for responsiveness

### JS
- Nice job using named functions for listeners
- Naming for functions could use some work - hard to follow at times
- Easy to read and follow code
- Nice job with SRP
- Be sure to understand the code that you find online for search functionality
- else if not necessary in lines 110 and 124. Could just use else
- Opportunities for refactoring upvote/downvote and editing for idea title and body

### GIT/GITHUB


## Functional Expectations
- Proficient The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals.

## HTML

## Accessibility
- Proficient Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.

## Style
- Proficient  Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.

## CSS

## Structure of Code
- Proficient Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.

## Implementation
- Proficient Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.

## JAVASCRIPT

## Data Types
- Proficient Can identify and track data types through any variety of functions, understanding their affect and result on each line of code. Knows which scenarios are better suited for objects vs. arrays and employs them accordingly.


## Conditional Logic
- Advanced Beginner Uses if/else statements, but there are multiple levels of nesting, which makes the paths through the code difficult to follow. Understands what is “truthy” and “falsey” in JavaScript.


## Functions & Scope
- Proficient Functions have single responsibility. The entirety of the function is easy to read what functionality it contains. Function is generally shorter than 8 lines. Uses functions to eliminate repeated code. Comfortable refactoring any piece of code and extracting it to a function.


## Arrays
* Advanced Beginner Can modify arrays by adding or removing specific elements - uses array methods such as push or shift. Can use a for loop to iterate through array.

## Objects & Prototypes
* Advanced Beginner Can use object constructor functions and is comfortable with extracting values of properties on different object instances.
* Proficient  Can use object prototypes. Can articulate the definition and the “why” of an object prototype - the best use cases for prototypes.

## DOM Manipulation
* Proficient  Able to extract information, modify attributes, or append/prepend data in the DOM easily regardless of whether they are employing vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. Understands how to harness event bubbling.

## Style
- Proficient Code is logically organized, such that reader can easily follow the progression of the app because variable and function names are descriptive and follow a single responsibility approach. There are no major bugs and minimal duplication.

## GIT & GITHUB

## Git
- Proficient Commits changes frequently with detailed commit messages. Uses feature branches to keep master branch free of incomplete features or bugs.

## GIT/GIHTHUB
- Proficient Is comfortable with resolving merge conflicts. Asks for review/merge of their pull requests from teammates. Is comfortable editing code based on review feedback from a pull request and resubmitting the branch code.

## DESIGN

## Comp Recreation
* Proficient  Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticeable and/or unintuitive than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.

## PAIRING

## Collaboration
- Advanced Beginner Can identify deltas in skill level and collaborate on methods whereby both pairs can share equitably in the workload. Can revisit the DTR to address changes that arise, and/or simply to keep one another reminded of the working plan.

## Feedback from Partner
I found Sage had a great understanding of the JavaScript and a lot of ambition to learn more. I had some trouble, keeping up him, and then I got sick, so we didn't have time to go over the code. I feel like I didn't get the opportunity to learn what I should have. I take as much if not more of the blame, since I came into the project less prepared, but I would have preferred to move at a slower pace, but to have learned more. It ended up being for the better, because with being sick, we would have had trouble handing the project in on time. This feedback, paints the experience in a worse light that how I felt about it. I enjoyed working with Sage, I was impressed with his understanding of the material. I appreciated Sage’s hard work, which was inspiring. In spite of being a smart coder, he was able to see his limitations and was quick to ask for clarification from others on specific points, which I consider an extremely valuable trait.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

I liked the Getting Better at Difficult Things. Understanding how to manage cognitive resources was massively beneficial. It sort of gave me a visualization of what is going on when your brain is stretching these resources too thin. I also was able to recognize the effect of my emotional state on learning prior to this, but it was hard to quanitify the effect or really grasp firmly what was going on until this. 

#### Well-Being_Stress Management

* [GitHub URL]()

Again, just being made aware the physical and emotional effects of poor stress management are really helpful. To be able to say to myself "okay I know what is going on with my learning process and why it is suffering" and then act upon that, be it with a nap or a walk outside. 

#### Mod 4 Leads

* [GitHub URL]()

I enjoyed the presentation by the Mod4 students on Burning Out. It was good to bring awareness to the fact this is something that happens to everyone and you should definitely acknowledge when it happens. Being able to put a label on that moment when you 'just cant' look at the project another second, is a very valauble skill in this basement. This gear up taught me how to act on the that issue, and I'm glad they did!


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I wasn't able to act in the community as much as I would have liked to, being that I was just becoming familiar with the environment. I'm looking forward to being able to give back to all the community that shared alot with me during the upcoming months, though, especially now that I hve a good idea of how I can do that. Especially with pairing. I'm going to make a point to pair alot in the future.
