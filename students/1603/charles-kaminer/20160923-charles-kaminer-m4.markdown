# Charles Kaminer - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to learn JavaScript as well as become more proficient learning other things on my own.  I also of course wanted to start getting stuff in order to prepare myself for the job hunt.  I think I was able to accomplish most of these goals and am happy with my overall progress as a developer.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

Idea box was our first JavaScript project in module 4 that occurred during week 1.  Our goal was to build out a single page Rails app that was a place to store, rank, and sort ideas.  As a introductory project to JavaScript I thought idea box was a great way to practice a new language while still using a Rails app that we were so familiar with.

Instructor Feedback:<br>
- use hidden field for full body when editing
- set constant on page load for search (in case of pagination)
- can pull out success/error reactions into helpers

Project Score: 153/150


#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ckaminer/scale_up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/independent_study_project.markdown)

Scale Up was our final project of Mod 4 which for me, was an independent study on Python and Linear Regression.  My goal was to tie in my main passions of Baseball, Math, and Programming.  My project objective was to write a quick program that would run a regression algorithm on a set of data on a given baseball team.

Instructor Feedback:<br>
Repo looks like it has details on running the code in the un-merged branch for the README - which is great. I’d challenge you to add a bit more detail on what the goal of the project is in that README as well (and definitely a link to your blog - which might be all you need since the blog gives a great explanation of the ‘why this is cool'). You may also want to add attribution for where the included sample data set came from and separate the data sets into their own folder. I took a few classes on data analysis on the internet, so CLEARLY I AM AN EXPERT, but I do think that’s a best practice… haha

If you continue working on this, one thing I would probably look at if I were reviewing this code for someone I was thinking of hiring would be having some simple unit tests, especially since you think you may currently have a bug. Since your test data is passed in and not hard coded, you should be able to throw some simple tests around it without too much heavy refactoring.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/icorson3/1603-gametime)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Gametime was our only paired project of the module.  Ilana and I chose to do a remake of the game 2048.  We decided to approach the game by building out a grid of linked lists representing each block in the square.  This was a successful project that was fun to work on.

- separate all listeners into own class
- callbacks on listeners in game class

Total Score: 285/300

"I worked with Charlie on Gametime. I was impressed with Charlie’s ability to pick up JavaScript so quickly. Our game involved a lot of logic pieces and although I was nervous about the logic, Charlie was able to wrap his head around it. There were times when Charlie got a little ahead of himself and the solution was easier than it was originally thought. Overall, Charlie was a great partner and we were able to support each other in things that we were uncomfortable with." -Ilana

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up

* [Getting Better At Difficult Things](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)<br>
For this Gear Up I learned more about how I learn.  The importance of emotional state while learning became more clear to me.  It was a nice reminder that sometimes when stress piles up and there is a lot going on in your head it can be better to take a break than continue increasing your stress levels.  POMODOROS!!!

* [There is an I in Team](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)<br>
I was not in Denver during this Gear Up as I was back on the East Coast for a Family Reunion.

* [Debugging The Gender Gap](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)<br>
For this Gear Up I really learned a lot about ways I can improve personally that can make an impact on others.  I was part of a really powerful discussion where we went over small things we can do that can make a large difference.  The biggest thing for me was not saying "Let me know if I'm being assertive" to people (esp. women) as it is just me passing more responsibility to other people.  I should be the one in control of my actions and not putting more pressure on others to tell me how to be a good person.


### Professional Development Workshops

I am currently waiting for my Turing graduate profile to be approved and published. This profile includes my summary and resume.

I learned a lot from our sessions with Lia, Allison, and Jim Ray.  Each session provided us with its own unique and vital information for our job search.  I especially enjoyed the negotiations session with Lia and the technical interview session with Jim.  With Lia I learned to always negotiate and some how to respond in situations that may have otherwise been uncomfortable.  With Jim I gained a lot of insight into what a company is looking for in a junior dev and what specific questions they may ask to verifty that you meet their standards.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

"Working with Ilana was as loud as one would expect.  We had a pretty good time all things considered and were able to put together a game to be proud of.  Ilana was supportive throughout the process and always willing to tackle problems head on.  We had a great partner balance and it was very nice being on the same page during those two weeks."<br>
-to Ilana for Gametime

### Being a Community Member

"I really enjoyed working with you in the Bezos posse.  Your passion for entrepreneurship really comes through in the group discussions that we have and you always have great contributions and perspectives.  I'm also glad you were willing to try a new direction with the posse.  I had a great time getting to pitch my personal project to the group and getting to work on it with students from other cohorts.  Thanks!"<br>
-Dan Broadbent, BE M2, Successor to the Bezos posse throne

### Playing a Part

Throughout my team at Turing I have tried to increase my role within the community each module and this module was no different.  During module 4 I resumed my role as co-leader of the Bezos posse which consisted of meeting 1-2 times weekly. We met for weekly lunch discussions as well as during Friday spike time where we tried something new this module based off of feedback from the posse.  We had our highest member count (even as a percentage of student population) since I started at Turing which I was very proud of.  I am confident I left the posse in a far better place than when I found it and am very happy with the two new leaders taking over next module.  In addition to being a posse lead, I was 1603's second SAB representative this module which was a very interesting experience.  I feel good about my contributions to SAB discussions and about the responsibilities to my classmates that was fulfilled each week by voicing their concerns/opinions at weekly meetings.  As well as holding these positions I tried to take an active role pairing with students from other mods (both programs) when possible and am confident that I was able to help students with project issues on multiple occasions.
