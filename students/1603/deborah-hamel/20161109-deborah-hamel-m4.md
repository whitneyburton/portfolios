# Deborah Hamel - (M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Graduate! Make up gaps and do what's best for my continued growth and learning.
My goals coming to Turing were to push myself as hard as I could and transition to new work as a programmer. I am committed to the Turing program, Turing community, and my own personal growth and learning. I will persevere through challenges and stay positive with an upward sloping trend. Looking back on Mod 1, I really am proud of the effort I have put into my own personal learning journey. I am looking forward to continued learning and opportunities to grow and be successful in a satisfying technical career.

This module, in particular, I wanted to:

1) keep up with pace of Turing everyday

2) practice and build new skills with JavaScript

3) be active in Pahlka

4) continue actively seeking opportunities for outreach, like afterschool programs and Boys & Girls club of Denver

5) start shifting to job outlook, have a resume by the end of the module

6) maintain a growth mindset throughout challenges

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Ideabox was my first project with JavaScript. I really felt better about jQuery and AJAX after I got that first function working.

#### Ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/deborahleehamel/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0)

Ideabox
 * In this project, we built a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas. Focus was on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. Ideally project relies on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.
 * This was my first project with JavaScript. Learning a new language can be intimidating, but mapping similar concepts we have learned from Ruby made it easier to gain some momentum.
 * Points 115/150

#### Scale Up/Independent Study

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/deborahleehamel/food_demo_react)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/module_4_assignments/ideabox2.0)

Independent Study
 * I really loved the pace of scale up. I am encouraged by the space I had to explore new things like React and mapping. It was a lot more fun to do research and coding exercises with an autonomous schedule. There was some ambiguity, but I am confident I can continue growing as an independent learner. 
 * Points 120/150

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Working with fellow Pahlka Posse members on an assigned project was nice. We have made a game that will be part of a larger narrative multi-game gallery with a healthy eating theme worked on together by our whole posse.

#### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/chompasina/gametime
  [Heroku](https://chompasina.github.io/gametime/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/module_4_assignments/gametime)

Empty Calorie Overlord & The Healthy Food Revival
 * A game with a healthy eating theme. The goal of the game is for the player to collect as much health food as possible while avoiding the junk food. The game consists of an overlord who spits out junk food, the tray for collecting the food, and falling health food. The variation in points for the health food reflects their respective ORAC scores.

 * Integrated into larger narrative game app with Pahlka Posse

### Features

* __33 points - Application is fully playable and exceeds the expectations set by instructors__ - Documentation was really solid. Definitely above and beyone expectations

### User Interface

* __15 points - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There are no holes in functionality and the application stands on its own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.__

### Testing

* __23 points - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.__

* dropped a few points for missing some core functionality from the tests (capturing food on tray/collision)


### JavaScript Style

* __17 points - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.__

### Workflow

* __25 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.__


### Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

* __15 points - Zero complaints__

total = 128


## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

* bounce back/don't give up
* keeping trying
* build a strong network and community
* be positive, frame things positively
* live and learn - look at challenges as opportunities
* open your heart/practice empathy - doing something for others increases seratonin -acts of kindness
* be grateful - gratitude for things that are going puts tragic thing in perspective
* take care of yourself - healthful habits are key to mental and emotional wellness
* hang on to humor - don't take yourself too seriously

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

* Our rights as US citizen are also responsibilities to our country and fellow citizens.
* The US presidential election is not the only election that matters. Other (smaller) statewide and local offices can have a significant, direct impact on our lives (safety, infrastructure, education) and can be powerful voices in a national conversation about how to support healthy, connected communities.
* Our primary or most prevalent sources of information about candidates should be recognized as agents that sway our opinions, and measured cautiously
* there is a shortage of candidates people are excited about or want to vote for, but this is also our responsibility to influence  

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

* Nice to have a gear up discussion with your own cohort - unique dynamic and relational vibe for the group
* I thought there was an interesting study that showed successful team dynamics where introverts led teams of extroverts or extroverts led teams of introverts
* Mix of personalities and persuasions and a respect of those differences can create empathy and balance in team outcomes and support different strengths equally


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Flower Exercise Follow Up

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/flower_exercise_follow_up.md)

* Committed to the idea of a job search support group
* reaffirms my  original 1511 community support
* find one thing to focus on for personal branding(twitter)
* importance of good mentors in first dev job
* how to turn a barrier into something actionable and positive in job search
* I know I want a collaborative culture to work in

#### Negotiations
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)

* specific strategies for navigating salary discussions
* always negotiate in person or via phone, never through email
* Consider all pieces of the offer, is there more value in negotiating another part of the offer than salary?

#### Scale Up: Writing a Blog Post & Peer Review
* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_four/negotiations.md)

[Deliverable](https://medium.com/@deborahleehamel/react-js-getting-to-know-you-1df3b9a0cbe8#.mjx7hf5lz)

#### Job Shadowing
* Our day at MojoTech in Boulder was amazing. They gave us so much time and attention, shadowing a review of a React project, discussions with multiple teams members in different roles and tons of advice.
* Key piece of strategic advice - Product company can be a good first dev job because you are working on a single code base and get lots of practice and experience in consistent architecture. VS Consultancy companies have multiple clients and multiple languages and code bases that can require you switch contexts a lot - but can be and exciting and challenging atmosphere to learn and grow.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback
[Allison]
Thank you so much for this excellent/organized documentation on our professional skills curriculum: https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills

I really appreciate the strategic time and attention you give to so many truly valuable resources for  us. On a personal note, I missed you this module and wish we could of schedule more chats. I hope you know how valuable and meaningful your support has been to me in every part of my journey at Turing. Thank you again. Keep doing what you do - it is solid gold.

[Tommasina]
Tommasina is a treasure. I am inspired by her social consciousness, empathy and inclusiveness every day. I worked with her on our Game Time project and was impressed by her precision, diligence and ability to analyze and work through any coding challenge that comes up. She was also a great leader on our project, taking initiative to coordinate schedules and strategies to stay productive. Effortlessly open, she spreads an atmosphere of community consistently and genuinely. She weighs in on heavy topics and sometimes I worry that she might ruminate in her worries too much, but thank goodness she cares so much. I can't wait to see all the interesting things she will do. I'm so glad we have connected and will we Pahlka friends for life!

[Karina]
Karina can crush some code. She is uniquely skilled at vocalizing what she is doing while coding and is a great pair. I really enjoyed working with her on Game Time. She has a great flexibility to work as a group or independently and is able to analyze and solve problems in the code and keep a project moving forward. I often see her helping people from other modules and volunteering her time and energy to community events and causes. My one worry is that she will spread herself across too many things, but I know she is working on how to stop saying yes to everything and balance her energy and time. She is also an uncommon and beautiful butterfly of friend.

### Being a Community Member

[From Tommasina]
I see in Deb indefatigable positivity, deep empathy for others, and a real willingness to listen to others and share in their story. I worked with her on our Game Time project and saw her put a lot of effort into understanding the material after hours. She also made sure our group of 3 was taking care to rotate driving and navigating, and following good git workflow which was helpful when it got a little harried at the end. I see how much she cares about the world around her—she is an active member of Pahlka, and the Turing community, and is often supporting other students through difficult moments. I have heard her belittling her coding skills and feeling worried about holding our group back and I want her to know that she is a great group member who contributed equitable high-quality code to our project. I hope that that feeling doesn't hold her back because the world needs her to be Deb, exactly as she is.  

### Playing a Part

[Community Involment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/tree/master/1605/module_4_assignments/extra-credit)


#### Boys and Girls Club of Denver - Teaching Kids to Code - Turing Outreach
  * Thursday, Oct 13 5-7pm
  * Thursday, Oct 20 5-7pm
  * Thursday, Nov 3 5-7pm

#### Arvada After School Program - Teaching Kids to Code with Casey - Turing Outreach
  * Wednesday, Nov 2 5:30-6:30pm

## Building activities and curriculum for Turing Outreach:
At Boys and Girls Club, we are experimenting with different things to engage kids in coding or problem solving. Sometimes the age can make a big difference and having a couple of options for activities can be good. We use [Make Your Own Website](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/outreach/hope_house.markdown) and also [Hour of Code](https://code.org/learn) coding games. We are trying to plan, structure and get feedback each time we do something there.

Another thing we are playing with at Boys and Girls club now is [Kodu game lab](https://www.kodugamelab.com). Kids can actually make games, but that might be more of a headache to load and require more patience and multiple sessions to actually create a project/game. It is a microsoft product, but it is pretty cool.

At Hope House when we taught a mix of adult and kids last module, a larger screen that someone can present on was helpful for those that might want to follow along with a step by step presentation of an exercise. When we go to schools or other places this may be a good strategy to present.

I am committed to continuing to do this kind of volunteer work and teaching after Mod 4. Ideally, Boys and Girls Club asks for at least one day a week commitments from volunteers. I can do this as an individual, but I would also like to keep working with Ken, who runs their computer lab, and build a relationship with the Boys and Girls Club of Denver & Turing School (including alumni, students and staff).
