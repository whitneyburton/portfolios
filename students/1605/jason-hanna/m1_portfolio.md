# Jason Hanna - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My name is Jason Hanna. Pay strict attention to what I say because I choose my words carefully and I never repeat myself. I've told you my name: that's the Who. The Where could most readily be described as a prison cell. But there's a vast difference between being stuck in a basement with no windows and being in prison. The What is hard: recently I planned and set in motion events to learn Software Development and Web Design. That's also the When. As for the Why: beyond the obvious financial motivation, it's exceedingly simple... because I want to. Which leaves us only with the How; and therein, as the Bard would tell us, lies the rub.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Automatic365/jungle_beats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/71ca0d64df95cb8ed07d26915159c972780f10de/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this three day project, I built a singly Linked List in order to make a very basic drum machine program.

Assessed By: Mike
Notes:
* 25 tests, in the future place in lib/ and test/ directories
* watch for edge cases, and organize tests along what theyre testing
* to_string depended on array functionality
* methods were pretty atomic
*  Watch for unnecessary variable assignment


### 1. Functional Expectations

* 2: Application is missing one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

#### Flashcards

Assessed By: Horace

Repo: https://github.com/Automatic365/flashcards

Notes:

* Solid project -- shows competent manipulation of ruby fundamentals -- demonstrating much greater comfort and proficiency
defining classes, defining methods, manipulating instance variables, etc etc
* Testing, especially on the Round class is looking really good -- shows a strong progression from very simple examples up
to more complex ones
* looked at a couple of small style points here and there but overall style looks clean, methods are short and readable,
relying on ruby idioms in good ways

## Soft Skills

### DTR:

#### Headcount DTR
###### What are your learning goals for this project?
* Our goals are to get 3's across the board and to both have full conceptual understanding of the project.

##### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* Our collaboration style will be to pair program and work through the project together. If one of us works ahead, that person will catch the other person up and walk them through the code they wrote.

##### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
 * We both communicate best by being blunt and direct.  We will make it work!

##### How would you describe your work style?
* Jason likes to plan before writing code.  David likes to roughly map out ideas in psuedocode, and dive in with limited planning.

##### What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* Nothing has gone poorly in our previous projects. We will sustain this by keeping each other in the loop and communicating.  We will set aside blocks of time to work.  If we get stuck, we will find an external resource. We will also timebox how long we work on something.

##### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* In order to do our best work we will communicate directly and make sure we have a clear understanding of what we're trying to accomplish in each iteration.  We will work at Turing so we can use a battle station and have access to resources in case we need help.

##### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* David has no scheduling restraints. Jason would require just a days notice if we need to stay late, since he has a puppy to take care of.   If we don't schedule in advance, he can only stay till 5:30 PM on Monday and Wednesday. We will plan to be here all day on this weekend, and we will try not to stay later than 9PM on weekdays.

##### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

* We will just say it.  

##### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* Jason requires a degree of understanding before diving in.  David is more comfortable with diving into unknowns, but needs to figure out when to take a step back and ask for assistance.

##### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* Atom, Terminal, Git, Github, Trello

##### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* The hierarchy is as follows: we will start with each other, move to another group working on headcount, look to another student in Turing, and finally go to an instructor.

##### How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* A project is successful if we have equal contributions and understanding of it and get all 3's.

### README:

#### Headcount

Project Overview

We'll build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation. What can we learn about education across the state?

Starting with the CSV data we will:

- Build a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data
- Build a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
- Build an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions


HEADCOUNT Original Spec: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown

Pair Project: David Tinianow and Jason Hanna

Iterations 1-4 and 5 complete. All tests spec harness tests are passing. The output from rake sanitation:all shows zero complaints. The rake runs in about 6 seconds with zero errors, failures, or skips.

Learning Goals

Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
Decompose a large application into components such as parsers, repositories, and analysis tools
Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
Connect related objects together through references
Learn an agile approach to building software

## Community

### Giving Feedback

#### Ryan Batty

Ryan is very knowledgable of Ruby and has a great logical way of tackling problems. He has guided me through many problems in a very patient, deliberate manner. He was always easy to work with. Communication was great and he great at giving me feedback that was always helpful.

#### Lane Winham
Lane's easy going attitude and ability to roll with the punches made working with him a blast, even during the most stressful of times. Though we didn't have any projects together, Lane is a great person to bounce ideas off of and get encouragement to explore ideas. During in class assignments, he was a great partner always willing to play whatever role suited the group best.

#### Sonia Gupta
Sonia has been an incredibly wonderful person to go through this module with. Her patience, humor, and spirit has made getting through the more difficult parts of this module easier. She's always composed and supportive, and always willing to help in any way she can. I look forward to working with her in the next module, and I think her experience will be a great asset to everyone in the class.

#### Pat Wentz
Pat was an amazing partner for HTTP. He is a very strong programmer, and his organization and foresight made what could have been a stressful project beyond manageable. I learned so much from him in ways to set myself up better for future projects, and assignments. He was also a clear and communicative partner which made it really easy to work together.  Beyond the project, I see Pat as a strong contributor to the Turing community. Many mod 1 students approach him for help and he is always patient and helpful.

#### David Tinianow
David was an excellent partner and a very dedicated coder. David’s patience and ability to communicate his ideas was a tremendous advantage in this project. I also greatly appreciated the he always made sure we were on the same page and never moved forward before I understood. He allowed me the opportunity to work through my thought process and always listened. David was dependable, committed, and beyond competent. Working with him not only pushed me to be better, but it was also a lot of fun.

### Being a Community Member

#### Sonia Gupta
Jason and I have gotten to know each other better recently as we’ve both decided to repeat the module. He has shown an incredible amount of resilience in the face of adversity, and I admire his ability to take things in stride. He never complains, and he really just puts his head down and does the work. He has a kind nature and an optimistic outlook that is wonderfully contagious. I’m glad that he will be part of 1605, and I think that his refusal to give up will continue to serve him well.

#### Ryan Batty
The time I had working with Jason was limited, though I did have the opportunity to do so on a number of in-class assignments. That said, whenever we worked together I found his easy-going attitude very easy to get along with, and our assignments went smoothly. Outside of coursework though I got to know Jason quite well. He was always very supportive when it came to others, and definitely the first to offer help if he could.

#### Lane Winham
Jason and I did not have the opportunity to be partners on a project. However, we had worked along side one another many times throughout the module. During these interactions he and I shared a common mindset in how we would like to progress through module 1. That being said we both had plenty of struggles and set backs but that did not keep Jason from forging ahead and working on his personal success. I look forward to spending more time in the dungeon with you!

#### David Tinianow
It was a pleasure working with Jason on Headcount.  His open-mindedness and easy-going disposition made him a great partner.  He was easy to work with, friendly, and dedicated.  Jason likes to see the bigger picture before diving into code, and I felt this approach was helpful during a complex project like Headcount.  He has a strong ability to map out ideas.  Sometimes it seemed Jason would hold back ideas if they were not fully fleshed out, and I would encourage him to share his ideas more frequently. I appreciated his willingness to put in long hours and fully commit himself to the project.  Jason was committed and calm all the way through to the end of the project.

#### Pat Wentz
 Jason and I paired for the HTTP project, and it was great
 to work with a partner so committed to completing a project the right way in
 terms of time commitment, attention to testing, and conceptual understanding.
 With Jason's ability to step back and look at the larger scope of a project,
 our styles meshed well together and I look forward to working with him again.


### Playing a Part

I was an active member of Hopper Posse, and participated in Imposter lunch, Productivity lunch weekly. I honestly engaged in Gear-Ups and I have also signed up for an elective every week.
