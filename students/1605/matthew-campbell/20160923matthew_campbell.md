# Matt Campbell - M3 Portfolio


## Areas of Emphasis

This module I was focused on learning Rails as best as I could focusing on API building and consumption.  I was particularly excited abut
This module has been tough personally for me. I set out to learn rails inside out, build and query APIs with ease, and learn how to create and execute complex SQL queries using SQL and ActiveRecord.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3

--------------------------------------------

### A: End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

##### 1. Ruby Style

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

##### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

##### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.**
* 2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but most new lines of code are not tested.
* 0: Developer does not use tests.

##### 4. Progression/Completion

* 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**
* 2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.

* 0: Developer is not able to implement basic functionality.

##### 5. Workflow

* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**
* 3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes
* 2: Developer does not commit regularly
* 1: Developer has poor git workflow and does not commit regularly
* 0: Developer committed once

The final assessment went pretty well for me.  I was able to do what I needed to do without much struggle.  Obviously, a bit more time would have been nice but I feel I have a good understanding of the material in mod 3.

### B. Individual Work & Projects

I enjoyed some work time without a group this module since we haven't experienced it since mod 1.  I do feel that I let life outside of Turing take over a bit more than usual during those times because I have had minimal family time over the past 18 weeks.  That being said, I believe I gained confidence knowing I could do all of this on my own.  I hope to spend some more time on my personal project in the next few weeks.

#### ApiCurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/api_curious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

ApiCurious started off a little slowly because I was a bit hazy on services, but the last day I really kicked things into gear.  I could have tested a bit more, but I did go back and learn to use VCR so I could use it on my personal project.  This was a fun project, but I think it would maybe be beneficial to be graded.  However, I can understand how burnt out people would be by the end of mod 3 if this was the case.

##### Evaluation

This project was not evaluated for a grade.

#### Accepted (Self-Directed Project)

* [GitHub URL For Demo Rails App With Gem Installed](https://github.com/matthewecampbell/accepted)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

I was very excited to get the chance to finally work on the self-directed project for a couple of reasons.  The first was that I had been wanting to build something similar to this since before I came to Turing.  Secondly, it is the culmination of our Ruby here at Turing.  I didn't get off to the start that I wanted being in Wisconsin for a wedding and then hit another road block with a funeral and wedding the following weekend in Wisconsin.  So I lost at least 4 days total on this project.  However, once I got moving, I think I did a very good job of consuming two APIs and serving up my own as well.  I am pretty happy with how it has turned out so far but would love to continue to work on the styling and add functionality.

## Team

### Projects

The group projects this mod were both challenging and fruitful.  I had a good mix of team members and learned much from them.  Our projects all went smoothly and we received quality grades because of it.

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MsJennyGiraffe/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The beginning of this project was a bit of a slog.  We did hit a strive and finished functionality pretty quickly.  I am also pretty proud of the testing we hit on this project and the TDD we practiced.  Trent was also able to push himself to implement a chat system which was pretty neat.

##### The Pivot Feedback

From Jenny:
Matt, you were so fun to work with. For the first time in my life, I very much enjoyed pairing. Your positivity and singing makes it feel like like work and more like just hanging out, but still productive. If I had one piece of advice it would be to focus more on git workflow. I know we had an issue early in the project with being on the wrong branch, but you figured it out. It's not a big deal, but something to keep in mind. I am impressed with the quickness of your work, and it's quality. It truly was a pleasure and I hope I get the chance to work with you again in the future.

From Trent:
Matt you did a good job with organizing the database structure and planning out how we would develop the structure of our application. Strong knowledge of rails and pathing, use of slugs and building out controllers, making consistent and measurable progress. But you could of applied some of that tenacity to tackling new challenges and implementing features in javascript, don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly like an eagle, into the future.

To Jenny:
Jenny, I think you did a great job keeping us on task and avoiding rabbit holes. I think your experience as a developer really showed on this project. Good job, project lead! I think when you're styling, you could be a bit more methodical making sure to put end tags in etc. and it will save you some time. I also appreciated your willingness to shoot for the stars with our features even if it was a bit out of your comfort zone. Overall, I really had a blast coding and bumping music in the basement with you. 10/10 would pair again.

To Trent:
Trent, I really liked your idealistic approach to development. It was fun to be a part of and actually watch you implement it. I have to admit, I doubted you'd get the chat system working the first few days - not because of lack of confidence in your abilities, but more because everyone always claimed the pivot was super difficult. I was very impressed when it was done because it was something completely new that any of us had ever attempted before -great work. Some room for improvement as far as working in a team would be to just keep us informed on your schedule and when you're driving be a bit more vocal about your thoughts. Overall, these are very minor things and easy fixes. I really enjoyed pairing with you since we were always having a good time but also crushing it with our code. Good work and I hope we get to pair again!

#### RalesEngine

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

I very much enjoyed this project.  It was a super great experience, especially pairing with Angela.  She was able to teach me a good amount about SQL/ActiveRecord.  It was a great pairing because we are both parents and on similar schedules.  This is the first time this has happened for me at Turing.  I had a great time creating an API and I think I may end up building out my Accepted API even more with good documentation since there's nothing really out there.  I am super impressed by our work ethic on this project and am thrilled we dropped all 4s and finished over a day early.

##### RalesEngine Feedback

  Angela and I gave verbal feedback to one another.


## D: Professional Skills

I have not fully completed my resume, but I have been working on my LinkedIn.

### Gear Up

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I did not attend the actual GearUp, but I was invited to participate in a bit of the planning for this exercise. It sounded like it yielded good discussions.

#### There is an I in Team

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I did not attend this session, but after watching the material it reminds me of a phrase a friend once told me.  "See written on the forehead of everyone you meet today: 'Make me feel important."  This is something I strive to accomplish in my day to day life.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I did not attend this session, but I watched the video.  And the pile-up on B is real.  This was a beneficial video to watch.

### Professional Development Workshops

#### Flower Exercise

[Link to Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VcBNPr5Q1A368tQNRJ9utljaX8VAj01tvfot0tz6Y2o/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a good exercise in helping me figure out where to begin my job search.  I have not yet completed it, but I will by the time next module begins.

#### Tech Interview session

This was easily the best professional development we've had while at Turing.  The content was very much relevant to what we will be experiencing and another hiring manager would be an awesome lecture to have.  

### Being a Community Member

I did not receive any feedback from the community.

### Playing a Part

I think I have always done my best to play a part in the community since it has been so great to me.  Last module, that largely came in the form of organizing the pairing sessions with mod 1 and serving on SAB.  This mod, in it's own way, I served the 1605 community by stepping down and allowing a vote for a new member since that is typically the case and was not going to be (go term limits!).  I also often paired with mod 1 students and some mod 2 students as well.  I feel as if I pretty much redid HeadCount the last two weeks.  I will openly admit that I intentionally skipped two of the GearUps this mod - once due to a skip baby and once due to a dire need of sleep since my son still hasn't figured out how to sleep more than 3 hours at a time.  This was the only time I have missed at Turing except the two days I was in Wisconsin.
