(Intro)

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dtinianow/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, I created a flashcard application that can be used from the command line.  Each flashcard displays a question, takes a guess from the user, and returns feedback about whether or not the guess is correct.  This project includes two extensions.  The first extension allows the user to ask for a hint. The second extension allows the user to generate flashcards by typing the name of a text file either in the program itself or as a command line argument.  This project was implemented using test driven development.

Assessed By: Brenna

Notes:
  - Total Tests: 31
  - Great test coverage
  - Two extensions: Accepting card files and hints
  - Could use more test coverage for sad paths
  - Will check into refactoring big methods
