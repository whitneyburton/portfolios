# Lane Winham - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

As a repeater, I set out to improve on the foundation that the rest of my time at Turing will surely build on. I also wanted to make it through this module with a sense of confidence that was absent for my previous attempt.

### End of Module Assessment

##### Challenge: What Can I Make

###### Assessed By: Horace

* Overall tons of progress -- getting to a decent spot

* Able to write code smoothly, not struggling with syntax, not struggling with basic language semantics

* Writing classes, writing methods, working with ivars

* Writing tests looks good -- needed a bit of prompting on the exact logic of these but overall looking good

* Like that we are using tools to break problems down into smaller steps, extract pieces of them into other methods, etc etc

* Only downside here is that the process ends up producing a slightly convoluted solution in some cases

* Would like to see you keep focusing on algorithmic thinking and logic, and recognizing which ruby tools match
most closely to the process you have in mind

* Also still stumbling occasionally on re-using a pattern that we've just seen elsewhere in the code


#### Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### Collaboration

* 3: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

### Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

For my personal projects I was assigned both Flashcards and Night-Writer.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laner12/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

* Flashcards is a mini game that a user will access through the terminal. They will then be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

###### Assessed By: Rachel

* project completed iterations 1-6
* clean code
* able to clearly explain classes and methods written
* good test suite

#### Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

#### Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

#### Night-Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laner12/night-writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

* Night-Writer is a encryption engine that converts latin characters into Braille. Then once the user needs, the Braille can be decrypted back into the starting letters.

###### Assessed By: Rachel

* able to clearly explain classes and methods written
* good test suite
* I could have tried to build methods to be reusable

#### Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### Test-Driven Development

* 3.5

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

#### Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

## Team

### Projects

During my pair and group projects I collaborated on HTTP and Black Thursday.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/twhitinger/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Built a server to introduce HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, while also working in paired groups.

###### Assessed By: Mike

* 25 tests

* In tests, make sure that we are testing more than the initial case of an item
* Make sure that state of the things are changing in the way that we expect them to

* Make sure to cover multiple cases in tests, so that a hardcoded response from any method will not continue to make tests pass.

* There are many opportunities to refactor for clarity and to separate out responsibilities.

#### Overall Functionality

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

#### Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

#### Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Laner12/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

* Headcount takes a number of CSV's that contain education related information for the state of Colorado and parses the data in a way that patterns and correlations can be seen.

###### Assessed By: Beth

* Completed through I4

* All spec harness tests pass through I4

* All team-generated tests pass

* Need more unit testing and edge cases, some nice testing around edge case -- want to see consistency here

* Lots of long methods (5+), if/else statements
Nice use of enumerables, some areas could be tighter
One code sanitation failure, line >80 chars; excluding given spec's long method names
Scores:

#### Functional Expectations

* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes

#### Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

#### Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:all shows...

* 4: Zero complaints

### Giving Feedback

###### Feedback to Erin Greenhalgh:

 Erin was a strong partner to have on our first pair project. Starting out we were able to work towards a common goal and shoot ideas off each other easily. After a few days had passed the dynamic between us and our workflow had altered due to my perceived lack in technical skill. During this shift in dynamic, Erin did such a wonderful job of including me in her thought process and presenting the code to me in a way that I could follow while we moved forward. She was very attentive and patient with me throughout the entire partnership. Erin demonstrated that she has a good understanding of ruby fundamentals but beyond that she demonstrated how adaptive and well rounded she is as a partner. Best of all the stress of the assignment never compromised her bubbly eager attitude!

###### Feedback to Parker Phillips:

Working with Parker on the final project Black Thursday was a great experience. Coming into this project I felt very unsure of my skills and how to manage the workload but that didn’t seem to phase Parker in anyway. After only a few hours of working with him I was amazed at his level of comprehension of ruby fundamentals and workflow. We were able to verbally work through issues and create the starting framework of the project. Once we had a rough plan, Parker was able to take it and run with it with flawless execution. I am very curious to see how fast he excels during this program. Overall Parker was a great team member. He would always keep me in the loop and never hesitated to take a step backwards to explain in a manner that kept me up to speed.

###### Feedback to Ryan Batty:

Ryan Batty: Working with Ryan on Black Thursday was a great experience. He had joined my group a few days after the project had started and for many that would have been a challenging feat. For Ryan however, the change was seamless and within minutes of looking over our current code base he was able to offer advice and positive critique. His influence within our group only grew. Ryan also did a great job making sure I felt like I was getting everything out of the project that I could, which demonstrated to me how strong his so-called soft skills are. Outside of our project Ryan is constantly helping other students with problems and questions. Overall he is a strong team player with outstanding coding skills.

###### Feedback to Jason Hanna:

Jason and I did not have the opportunity to be partners on a project. However, we had worked along side one another many times throughout the module. During these interactions he and I shared a common mindset in how we would like to progress through module 1. That being said we both had plenty of struggles and set backs but that did not keep Jason from forging ahead and working on his personal success. I look forward to spending more time in the dungeon with you!

###### Feedback to Raphael Barbo:

Rapha or Raphael as you may know him was a great partner to pair with. We certainly felt the pressure that Turing can create but Rapha always maintained his composure. He demonstrated a good workflow in addition to cohesive problem solving. I would pair with him on any project!

###### Feedback to Trent Whitinger:

Trent was a great partner to work with during our pairing on HTTP. I think we hit the ground running in terms of team cohesion, we rapidly  found our strengths and worked with them. He was always willing to try out new ideas or approaches to the issues at hand.  I believe Trent will do well in this environment!

### Being a Community Member

###### Feedback to me from Erin Greenhalgh:
 Though I know it was frustrating for Lane to feel like he couldn’t contribute as much on our HTTP project, I appreciated his willingness to stick it out and work through the problems as much as he could. I also really appreciated his positivity, friendliness, and flexibility. His easy-going manner and can-do attitude makes him a pleasure to work with.

###### Feedback to me from Parker Phillips:
 Working with Lane on Black Thursday gave me a better insight into his skills as a developer. He was very upfront early about his strengths and weaknesses to let me know where he was at. It was very obvious that one of his strongest areas of coding was being able to conceptualize what needed to be done; I know he is repeating the module to iron out his weaknesses, but it is exciting to see where he will go with his talents. It was also apparent how hungry Lane was to learn more. He was a patient partner, but was absorbing as much as he could. He didn't let setbacks get him down, and his drive and motivation is incredibly admirable.

###### Feedback to me from Ryan Batty:

Lane Winham: If I had to describe Lane in one word, it would be fluid. Working with Lane never presented any difficulty, and any time he may of had difficulty, he was very adept at working with myself and/or Parker to resolve the issue. His fundamental understanding and skill at breaking down problems is top-notch, though I know his largest goal is to improve his technical understanding of Ruby, and the tools it provides. Regardless of any faults in his technical understanding, his ability to work on a team and collaborate was really inspiring, and provided a way goal for myself to aspire to.

###### Feedback to me from Trent Whitinger:

Lane has a strong eye for managing git workflow, developing a plan of action to tackle and break down large problems into manageable chunks. He keeps a positive attitude in the face of difficult and overwhelming difficulty. He is also just a great guy to work with!

##### Feedback to me from Raphael Barbo:

Lane was a great partner to work with, extremely easy going, super dedicated, and with an amazing personality, I'd absolutely enjoy working with him again ! I can't wait to see what the future holds for this amazing human being.

### Playing a Part

During the last six weeks I have done my best to help the current students of module one. I have done this by answering questions, talking about my experience as a repeater, and collaborating one assignments and problems. I am also a member of the Hopper Posse.
