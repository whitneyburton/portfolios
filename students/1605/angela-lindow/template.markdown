### Areas of Emphasis

During this module, I hoped to really grasp object oriented programming, logic, and Ruby. I wanted to learn the importance of Test Driven Development and how it can lead you to write code that is easily readable and practical. Honestly, at the beginning of the module, I didn't know what I didn't know, so my main goal was to just soak up everything that I could. As the module went on, my goals became more specific. Some of those goals were to strive to have code that is DRY, continually ask myself if I am applying SRP, thoroughly understand Objects and their attributes, and get better at spotting opportunities for meaningful refactoring. Having these things on my radar was a huge help during my projects. I am amazed at how much I have learned and accomplished this mod! Things that seemed impossible have become attainable.

### End of Module Assessment

**Feedback from Beth**
​- Syntax: overelied on if statements, used if @stock.keys.include?(item) instead of simply if @stock[item], able to address errors and issues easily, often had multiple solutions to an issue
- Testing: Read errors closely, some jumping ahead, generated tests with ease, used to drive development
- Workflow: smooth/fast navigation, typing speed, test setup
- Collaboration: Asks questions, defines approach, then calibrates

### Work

I completed the following projects this module:

#### Flashcards

* [GithHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/projects/tree/master/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

This project was a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user is able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. I completed extensions which allowed the user to load a txt file of "cards" from the command line and provided them with a new txt file of their guesses, correct answers, and score.

**Feedback from Brenna**
* 28 Assertions
* Use of pause function was sweet!

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumberable & Collections: 4


#### Night Writer

* [GithHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/projects/tree/master/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This project translated latin characters to Braille-like text and vice versa. It was a great project to get comfortable with manipulating and accessing elements in an array with Enumerables.

**Feedback from Jhun**
* soft 3s for tdd and breaking logic into components. - could look at creating the brailer converter into 2 classes (eng - braille) (braille - eng) - a lot of loops but adhearing to the speck she passes

## Team

### Projects

Working in a pair, I completed the following projects this module:

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/http-project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

We built a functioning server that responded to Get and Post requests via Postman. Get requests could be made to check the date/time, a counter, and took a parameter for a word search. Post requests could be used to play a number guessing game which redirected to a page that gave you feedback on your guess.

**Feedback from Mike**
* All functionality works
* 35 tests
* Generally good tests, make sure you test for different        cases, and for possible edge cases.
* Generally well written code, there are some opportunities to refactor complex conditionals and longer conditional branches.
* Opportunity to refactor messages out into a module, look at how you can reduce reliance on instance variables

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Drive Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/allindow/headcount)

Using data about schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation, we built code that allowed us to analyze data and pull correlations for districts across the state. It included three layers: data access, relationships and analysis. The Data Access Layer allowed us to ask questions about the raw data. The Relationships Layer allowed us to compare the data of one district to another, or statewide. The Analysis Layer allowed us to see if there were any correlations that could be made given a set of data.

### Feedback to Me

**From Yoseph Anderson**: Angela is a dependable partner that displays a strong hunger for problem solving. She has strong determination facing setbacks, and works well under pressure. During the project, she was able to drive and keep a strong and steady pace to not fall behind on finishing the project and hit the ground running. She displayed well developed organization skills.

### Feedback from Me

**Yoseph Anderson**: Yoseph is a fun, energetic, and efficient partner to have on a project. He keeps things light-hearted and also has a good eye for opportunities for refactoring. He was able to contribute equally while driving or while talking while I drove. He was able to keep a good momentum going during times when I was feeling stuck.

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I looked up everything I could find about Turing when I was considering attending, so I have been tweeting about my time at Turing with the #turingschool for anyone who, like me, wondered what the student experience was like.
* During projects, I often take breaks to walk around and check in with my peers and see how they are doing and talk about anything they may be stuck on. When anyone has a question, I do my best to research the issue and ask them questions or provide suggestions that could help them come to the answer they are looking for. I am looking forward to helping the next new cohort, as well.
* I have brought my stepson to Kids Who Code and am looking forward to assisting George and Heidi when it starts up again!
