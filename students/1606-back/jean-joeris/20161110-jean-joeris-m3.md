*   Did the team push themselves by taking risks?
    *   **1: Yes**

#### From Brendan:
You had a really good high-level understanding of how some of the more difficult pieces of our project worked, which was really valuable. In addition, you did a great job of stepping up as the project manager and keeping our workflow organized through waffle. However, whenever we divided up our workflow on a small scale informally, you tended to be a little more scattered. While I respect that jumping between ideas is how you work best, it would be helpful if you were able to better switch into a more organizational project triage mode for stand-ups.

#### From Susi:
Jean - It has been a pleasure working with you on this project. Thank you for stepping up into the Project Management role at the last minute; I really appreciate your flexibility on that. It is not an easy role and you did a great job. As soon as you were asked to be the PM, you dove in, started arranging cards and getting people's tasks lined up. Terrific! You tend to move extremely quickly both in code and speech and slowing down would be a benefit to team mates as well as yourself. At the end of the project when we were working on finishing up the tasks prioritized for us, it was hard to follow the tasks you were planning on taking versus what the other members of the team were supposed to do; it was hard to follow the speed of your thought process. By slowing down we can all start to see the tasks more clearly. Your technical knowledge and ability to look at the project from multiple angles at the same time is amazing and commendable. I can't tell you how much your refactoring improved our project. Thank you for everything.

#### From Ryan:
Jean is one of the most talented people I have ever run into in my professional life. His ability to grasp a concept and understand its function and the logic behind it is uncanny. Specific to this group, Jean stepped up during some difficult emotional hurdles and steered us back onto the path of success. While Jean's ability to grasp technical concepts is incredible, his knowledge can be overwhelming at times. I consider myself a rather confident programmer, and, for me, pairing with him became intimidating at times. Now, I'm not saying he is purposely flaunting his knowledge or intentionally drowning out other voices, I just think his excitement for the problem gets the best of him. My advice is to reign back and focus that excitement. There are times that his excitement is great in context, but the self-awareness for those times and places is not fully-developed. When Jean learns how to convert all of his positive energy towards the group, his skills will know no bounds.

(Intro)

### Mind on The Ball (self-directed project)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/football_machine_learning)

The goal of the project was to build a neural net to analysis previous football performance and predict future performance. I chose to pair with Brian Heim on this project, and his experience with statistics and football was invaluable.  Additonally, we wanted to make a resource that Armstrong could reference back to. As Armstrong members we noticed the quick turn-over at Turing stopped us from digging into really hard topics, and we thought our website could somewhat counteract that.

**1. Completion**

* **4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**

**2. Organization**

* **3: Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.**

### Technical Quality

**1. Test-Driven Development**

* **4: Project shows exceptional use of testing at different layers (above 95% coverage).**

**2. Code Quality**

* **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

### Product Experience

**1. User Experience**

* **3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.**

**2. Performance**

* **3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.**


## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Personal Project pitch
### Mind on The Ball

#### Pitch

Mind on The Ball is an application that presents predictions based on historical data and provides an educational resource for learning about Neural Nets through NFL football statistics.

#### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.

1. Learning about Neural Nets is hard and without context, can be overwhelming (Normalizing data, constructing network, calculations).
2. Football data UIs are a little outdated (all HTML)
3. Good Football APIs are expensive and hard to come by

#### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

1. Blog posts documenting process will explain many of these issues, and potentially serve as a resource for Armstron Posse.
2. Will utilize JavaScript/AJAX to speed up requests and limit need to refresh, improving UI
3. Football Stats will be free to use and transparent with an API being provided.

#### Target Audience

1-3 sentences describing what type of user your app would be applicable to.

1. Students wishing to gain knowledge about machine learning, specifically Neural Nets.
2. Football fans who want lightweight statistics on their favorite players with predictions for future performance.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### To Ryan:
You did an awesome job getting us deployed to production, including learning about the asset pipeline. You could work on how you cope with your frustration, as it can be difficult when you get frustrated at each roadblock. That said, you overcome the roadblocks fine.

#### To Susi:
You did a great job advocating for your needs in the group and keeping us update as to where you were at. You could have told us earlier near the start of the project, but once you told us the communication was awesome.

#### To Brendan:
You did a great job contributing well factored semantic code. I know you are an introvert and that is good. When you speak it carries more weight because of it. However, there were a few times when we were doing remote work where I didn't know what the status of your work was. It would have been nice if you had given an update, even if it was just saying you were still working.


### Being a Community Member

#### From Anna Dolan:
This module I got to know Jean through joining the Armstrong posse and attending posse meetings and spikes. Jean is an excellent teacher, and worked very hard to present difficult concepts to a group of people with mixed experience. I really enjoyed being in Armstrong this module, and I hope to continue to work with & learn from Jean next module as well
