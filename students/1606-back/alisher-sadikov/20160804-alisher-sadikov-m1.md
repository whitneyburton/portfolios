# (Alisher Sadikov) - (M1) Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to Turing, I had had very little exposure to object-oriented programming and lacked computer science fundamentals. So my main goal for Module 1 was to get myself familiarized with those.

### End of Module Assessment

Notes:

  * Great talking out loud through process, collaboration and consultation
  * Focused on incremental steps
  * Identifies some best-choice ruby syntax (Hash.new(0)), struggles to immediately identify some fundamental tactics (+=)
  * Understands most Ruby fundamentals re syntax
  * Struggles at times to navigate intersection between classes
  * Needed some strategic help to determine solid approach for moving forward

1. Ruby Syntax & API: 2.5
2. Completion and Progress: 2.5
3. Testing: 3
4. Workflow: 3
5. Collaboration: 4
6. Enumerable & Collections: N/A

### Work

In this module, I worked on the following projects: Flashcards, Battleship(incomplete) and Chisel (to earn a retake).

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/project-flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

A flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

* Functionality: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 4

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/battleship_2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

A playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.

Evaluation comments:
 * Struggled with concentration during the project
 * 12 tests, 10 pass
 * Went for a top-down approach that struggled
 * Next time try a bottom up approach and build some small components to gain familiarity
 * Not a lot of code/functionality to look at

Scores:
  * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
  * Enumerable & Collections: 2
  * Test-Driven Development: 2
  * REPL Interface: 2
  * Breaking Logic into Components: 2

  #### Chisel

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alishersadikov/battleship_2)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

  This project is centered on Markdown and HTML. If you don't have experience with those two technologies it'll be hard to really understand how to construct/implement your code.

  Scores: passed

## Team


### Projects

I worked on Night Writer and Enigma(incomplete)

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse will be implemented.

Scores:
* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

Kinan Whyte: "Alisher has been a great joy to work with on our project together. He is an open book when it comes to learning, able to write in chapters and ways of thinking that are offered by any parties around us while contributing fresh perspectives of his own. In times where our project demanded long hours and focus through solving difficult algorithms, he his persisted with great will, strength, balance and awareness of workflow. He will prove truly valuable to any team in his way of providing an intelligent and grounded approach to problems solving."


## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Kinan Whyte: "Kinan is a great team player and I really enjoyed our pair project. He has a very positive attitude and does not give up despite some challenging parts of the project. I also respect the fact that he is able to work very long hours and is never tired of exploring new ideas and approaches."

### Being a Community Member

I joined Grace Hopper posse and took part in meetings.

From Michael Hill: "Alisher was a great partner on the Enigma project.  He seems to truly enjoy programming and it showed in his ability to not only work through the daily challenges, but also in his desire to make sure we were both on the same page throughout the project. He seems to have a unique ability to ask the right questions at the right time, which helped catch problems before they became big problems. If I struggled with certain concepts he was always willing to take a step back to review things until I understood . I’m hopeful we will be able to work together again at some point in this journey."

### Playing a Part

I brewed coffee when I arrived early in the morning.
