# Brian Heim - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to take some risks this module. Since I came away with a good understanding of Rails basics from Mod 2, I wanted to see what new things I could try (JavaScript, Machine Learning, Python, etc.). I also aimed to be more active in my posse (Armstrong) and in the community. My ultimate goal however, was to hone and obtain new skills and to get closer to being a "job ready" junior developer by the end of the module.

## A: End of Module Assessment


### 1. Ruby Style

* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**

### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Testing

* **2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.**

### 4. Progression/Completion

* **3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.**

### 5. Workflow

* **4: Developer commits every 15 minutes**

* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md]
* [https://mind-on-the-ball.herokuapp.com]

__Project__ description:

The goal of the SDP is to create an app that will authenticate with a third-party service, consume an api, and solve an actual problem.

Jean and I decided to create an app that would generate statistical predictions for the NFL. We set out to accomplish this using a machine learning algorithm called a Neural Net. The app also contains an educational blog section that documents our process during the creation of the neural net. In addition, there is a page that displays large amounts of statistical data acquired from an external api.   

Project Partner: Jean Joeris

### [Mind On The Ball]

### Pitch

MOTB is an application that presents predictions based on historical data and provides an educational resource for learning about Neural Nets through NFL football statistics.

### Problem

1. Learning about Neural Nets is hard and without context, can be overwhelming (Normalizing data, constructing network, calculations).
2. UI is a little outdated (all HTML).
3. Good Football APIs are expensive and hard to come by.

### Solution

1. Blog posts documenting process will explain many of these issues, and potentially serve as a resource for Armstron Posse.
2. Will utilize JavaScript/AJAX to speed up requests and limit need to refresh, improving UI
3. Football Stats will be free to use and transparent with an API being provided.

### Target Audience

1. Students wishing to gain knowledge about machine learning, specifically Neural Nets.
2. Football fans who want lightweight statistics on their favorite players with predictions for future performance.

### Integrations

* API
 * NFL Fantasy API
* OAuth integration
 * Github

## D: Professional Skills

### Job Shadowing Experience - Trelora

I got the opportunity to shadow the developers at Trelora for an afternoon with three other Turing students. The experience was not only helpful and informative, it was also really fun! The codebase that Trelora uses is very similar to what we see at Turing every day: Ruby and JavaScript. This was very fortunate because we were able to 'pair' with each of the developers and actually help them troubleshoot and progress on different tasks, which was a pretty amazing feeling. In addition to being adept programmers, it is worth noting how welcoming and easy to talk to they were. The dev team lead Keith was an awesome host and gave us meaningful advice during our Q&A session regarding the job market, interviewing, and the job hunt in general.

### Gear Up

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

I liked discussing this Gear up with our Cohort and Instructors. It was cool to see which personality type my fellow classmates identified with, and how they felt based on that criteria. I learned alot about myself as well, very valuable session.

* [GitHub Gist Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)


#### Vote Your Conscience

I thought this was a thought provoking session, maybe not as valuable as the other Gear Ups, but it fostered a great discussion. Being an election year, it was relevant and interesting to see how others viewed voting.

* [GitHub Gist Link](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)


#### Resilience

This was a good Gear up as well. The discussion our group had was meaningful and productive. I learned alot about the people in my group and the struggles they have ahd to overcome.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for David Davydov

* Working with David on this project was a great experience. He is a very talented programmer with exceptional hard skills, his typing speed and TDD are especially noteworthy. He did a very good job of examining and testing edge cases to ensure that our code was as rock solid and performed as expected. David is a conscientious person when pairing and regularly seeks collaboration. When we worked on consuming our API externally, David and I consistently would step-back when stuck, and read documentation and discuss a plan of attack before moving forward and I found this to be a very successful part of the project. I appreciated David’s strong work ethic and motivation to be constantly working because it is an encouraging trait to have in a project lead, but I would challenge him to make more time for regular breaks. There were times when David would work through Pomodoros and lunch, which is a personal choice, but in my experience, in order to reduce the feeling of “burnout” and to re-focus the mind, regular breaks from coding is very beneficial. Overall, David is an amazing person to work with and I consider him one of the strongest coders in the cohort.

#### Feedback for Nate Anderson

* This was my first time working with Nate since being at Turing, and while we only paired on a small section of the code, I enjoyed working with him. Nate is easy-going and open to suggestions when writing code, which makes for a relaxed pairing environment. He regularly complimented other members of the group which was very encouraging and appreciated. Nate did a good job of checking in when the group was split into pairs (David and Nate, Rapha and myself), he would regularly check in with us and update us on their progress and sought to understand what we were working on as well. While Nate was very easy to work with, I would challenge him to assert himself into a “lead” role more often, when we paired I did most of the driving, and I noticed that this was the case with other team members as well. Navigating is an important skill to have, but assuming the Driving role is important to solidifying skills, and further advancing as a developer in general. Overall I genuinely enjoyed working with Nate and his laid-back and friendly demeanor.

#### Feedback for Raphael Barbo

* Working with Rapha on this project has been very enjoyable. He is very energetic when working and would get visibly excited when we solved problems. This energy was infectious and helped motivate me at times when I was feeling tired, especially when he and I tackled implementing jQuery datepicker to show a calendar of available dates for a listing. He is also a very determined and hard worker. Rapha regularly worked late or worked at home after the group disbanded for the night, experimenting and implementing better test coverage. He is a strong communicator and freely speaks his mind which is a great strength, but he could work on his delivery as sometimes he can come off too strongly or a little harsh. He commented on the preliminary CSS styling I had done for the site in a way that was not very constructive, but then he apologized and clarified his intent, which showed his maturity and grace, and was quite impressive to me. In fact, he and I worked on the final styling of the site and he was incredibly complimentary and encouraging. Overall I really enjoyed working with Rapha and look forward to pairing with him again.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback for Brian (From Nate Anderson)

* I really enjoyed finally getting a chance to work with you on a project. Our pairing time was very productive, but also light and fun which made everything much easier. Your work with the css was amazing and it was really fun watching our site come to life like that. Your dedication to getting every aspect exactly right was great to watch. I have tried to rack my brain to come up with a criticism to no avail. Your work ethic is great and it was a pleasure working with you.

#### Feedback for Brian (From David Davydov)

* Brian, you were a great team member and I strongly valued your easy-going personality and dedication throughout our project. You did a fantastic job in making our site look professional, implementing the right CSS for image cropping, centering, and all that other stuff that the rest of the team was not doing. Your commitment to the styling of the site was invaluable, and your git workflow in terms of periodically applying these stylistic changes to the progress we've made turned out to be very intuitive. Your understanding of the site's layout was solid by the end of the project, when you gave me the rundown on how to match our review form to have the same style as the other forms. In an area of growth, I would suggest that when something in the code or project is not clear, do not hesitate to pause the pairing session and use it as an opportunity to learn. There were times during our pairing that you made some suggestions that seemed random which gave me the impression that your understanding of the code flow was not fully solidified. This was never anything more than minor, but reading code is crucial and I would suggest you always stay on top of lubricating these gears of dis-clarity whenever they seem to get stuck - it will pay off dividends in the long run. You were always fun to work with and level-headed throughout the project and our team strongly benefited from having you as a partner. Thank you for your hard work and patience.

#### Feedback for Brian (From Raphael Barbo)

* Brian is very easy to work with, as far as technical skills it was really fun to work with Brian because I feel we are at the same level, and it allowed both of us to contribute towards the features we were working on.
My constructive feedback to Brian is just to keep listing to people's ideas, and different approach to problems. The beauty of being a developer is that the are 200 ways to solve the same problem.
I really enjoyed working with him, and I am looking forward to see what he accomplishes throughout his time at turing.
