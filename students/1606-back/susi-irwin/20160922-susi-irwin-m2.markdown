# Susi Irwin- M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I want to work on my confidence level in and with my coding. I will gain confidence in experimenting within my code while I am working and really using my tests and errors to drive my Development. This module I am setting the goal for myself to further my skills HTML and CSS in relation to a Rails application. The MVC structure as well as CRUD practice will be key focus areas for me. I want to be able to be a contributing successful member of my cohort and of group projects. I would like to see dynamic pages based on database data in our Little Shop of Orders Project. A side goal has been to really work on my typing as well; improving my typing will not only boost my confidence as a software developer, but also increase my efficiency and productivity levels. I set a goal for myself at the end of Module 1 to not put unrealistic pressure on myself and instead use my passion and drive as motivation to really learn the material and apply it to my work. I feel that after 6 weeks in Module 2 I have come leaps and bounds from where I was in Module 1. I want to leave this module feeling like I have a solid understanding of the concepts presented to me. In my posse (Pahlka), I will be a more active member working on the technology side of things. I will be a leader of the imposter lunch series. Developing my communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills is something I also plan to work on throughout the module.. I want to be a positive influence on and member within the Turing Community.

* Pay attention to areas where refactoring is required
* Continue talking out my ideas and thoughts, and remember to ask for input when I feel stuck.
* Keep practicing

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module was extremely saturated with challenging solo projects and side work. Each day we would learn between one and three new ideas, theories, or concepts and be expected to implement them as soon as that evening in an assignment. Not all of my projects are complete, but I did my absolute best to follow the specs, ask questions, and work thoroughly on my code.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/susiirwin/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

Robot World was my first real attempt at a Sinatra Application. It was a complicated project because not only was I developing a web application on Sinatra for the first time, I was also working with a database for the first time. Starting with a YML file, I was able to build out our robots in the application. After a few days, the challenge was to convert that YML to a SQL database; this was both challenging and amazing! The SQL commands proved to be extremely powerful. I was pleased that I took on the challenge of performing calculations with SQL queries instead of raw Ruby code. I was also able to implement Bootstrap to make a visually appealing website with clean layouts and formatted tables. This assignment was where CRUD really came to life for me and I started to understand and appreciate the code to database relationship. With this application I was really able to sink my teeth into CSS and Bootstrap to do some fun design tweaks to the application, such a layout for my Data page as well as styling for the data tables.

No Evaluation Scores for this project.

#### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/susiirwin/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Blogger was a tutorial that had us create a Blogging platform. The most amazing part of this lesson was seeing how the items within a database relate to each other and how we could link them around the site. Blogger reinforced the MVC, Data Structures, Routing, Migrations, and site construction. We used our form_for syntax in blogger and learned how to make forms that were meaningful and efficient.

No Evaluation Scores for this project.

#### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/susiirwin/mix-master)
* [Original Assignment]()

Mix Master was a weekend-long tutorial dealing with complex relationships in a database - one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many. The real world application was extremely useful here as we could see how applications we use daily (Spotify, Itunes, Amazon Music) work and are constructed. The challenge here was implementing our own code after following along with tutorial steps and approaches while constantly keeping in mind the CRUD patterns and best practices. Another huge challenge in this project was to implement OAUTH with Spotify. This was incomplete for me due to hangups on the OAUTH piece taking way longer than I anticipated.

No Evaluation Scores for this project.

#### Rails Mini-Project: IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/susiirwin/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

IdeaBox was a super fun project involving creating a Rails app from scratch that would allow a user to login, create ideas, read ideas they had created, edit and update those ideas, and eventually delete them if needed. It also introduced the idea of an Admin Role to us. We were taught the practices of Authentication and Authorization and created the Admin Role - a user who can control more of the backend functions of the application. This project was a challenge for me because I really took my time to make sure I understood each step that I was taking. Because of this attention to detail I tend to run out of time on the shorter projects. During our Peer Review, I worked with Jean on some refactoring. I implemented Hound as well as the Awesome-Print gem. I learned that I am way more confident in my coding than I thought I was, but I also learned that I need to continually work on experimenting with my code and taking chances.

No Evaluation Scores for this project.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Projects in Module 2 are extremely challenging, but not for the reasons I anticipated, i.e. more challenging code and problems; the larger challenge in this Module is that onset of working in groups for projects. The soft skills that were introduced and discussed in Module 1 actually come into play in Module 2. We use all of the Project Management tactics and really focused on Agile methodologies. Feedback sessions with Casey and Allison were extremely helpful during this module. We learned about specific, actionable feedback and understanding how to give and receive that feedback in the most productive ways possible.

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bcgoss/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)
* [Project DTR](https://gist.github.com/susiirwin/1d563f5e722925484a2571e1414a4606)

This application designs and creates a Web Traffic application that takes in and analyzed web site traffic so that Business Intelligence reports and can run and read by a user. We needed to use a JSON parser to update the formatting of an incoming payload, then write a custom parser to populate a database with the appropriate data. We needed to design a Sinatra application to post this information to a website that would allow a user to see the information about their site. We used CSS and Bootstrap to design these pages with ERB to create dynamic pages with correct information.

Our main feedback centered around making sure that we ask for help/assistance earlier rather than later. It is not productive to cycle in issues for as long as we did in some areas. We also need to make sure that we cover all of our methods with tests, as we did not have coverage for our client methods. Our cURL returns looked really good. Casey mentioned that more descriptive body messages would be helpful. Our views should not include any logic - just display properties. Casey also suggested having a separate model to handle client requests in an effort to keep logic out of the controller.

#### Rush Hour Scores
#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 2.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* 2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3.5: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.
* 3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### 7. Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

#### Feedback from Group Members
From **Nate Andersen**: "You made me smile on a daily basis and definitely helped make everything lighter in some of the more tense moments of the project. The organization you displayed kept our team going in the right direction and made our workflow that much more smooth and easy. The analytics tables in the views were a work of art and added some aesthetic flare to the project that I would not have been able to do. I would like to see a little more confidence in your knowledge as you added a lot to the project, but that is something I believe will come with time and experience. Overall, wonderful partner and I really enjoyed working with you."

From **Bryan Goss**: "I really appreciate the way you kept us all on task and organized. Our waffle board was always in good shape, and you were often the one who suggested switching roles (driver/navigator). As I said in retro, I think you’ll benefit a lot from saying out loud what you expect a given change to do. A good example is rake db:test:prepare. What does it do and why do you use it? Near the end of our project it became a ritual that, as far as I could see, you didn’t really understand. We’re all here to learn and recognizing that feeling of not understanding is a good opportunity to learn something. Another thing I really liked was the way you took ownership of the migrations. I love the way our database looks and you seem to have really mastered all the skills that go into setting it up."

#### Little Shop - The Waddams Emporium

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)
* [Heroku URL](https://secure-stream-76661.herokuapp.com)
* [Project DTR](https://gist.github.com/susiirwin/b14ea7c105e14841f9c0a46a1a3e36f6)

This project was an amazing experience for me. In a group of 4, I was able to pair quite a bit with my team. We built an entire e-commerce store from the ground up - including the idea of what our store would sell and what it would be called. It was truly our first truly creative project at Turing. This complicated application is built on Rails using Postgresql. We used CRUD to build out all of the features to this application as well as custom routes, authentication, authorization, and the use of the Amazon AWS API. Our team focused on Rails best practices, as well as implementing an Agile style workflow. This project reinforced all aspects of the Rails Web Application Development Process that we have learned during this Module.

#### Little Shop Scores

#### Feedback from Group Members
From **Sonia Gupta**: "Susi was such an incredibly supportive team mate. Her optimism and drive made it an absolute blast to work with her. She was willing to push through the difficult parts of the project while maintaining composure. I was most impressed with Susi’s supportive attitude when pairing. I have often been second-guessed and limited by partners who don’t trust that I am capable of coding. Susi never made me feel that way. She was open and willing to try things with me, and was patient even when I failed. I also learned a good bit of CSS from her and look forward to learning more! One thing Susi might work on is decompressing a bit when tricky bugs pop up. We had a moment on the last day of the project where our logout functionality was not working. Susi seemed to be quite distressed, but she pushed through and helped us to find a solution. I would encourage Susi to remember that she is absolutely capable of moving through these difficulties the next time a bug pops up so that she can retain her optimism even during the rough patches. I think we could both probably stand to remember that about ourselves!"

From **Jesse Spevack**:
###### Strengths
"Susi's strengths are wide ranging, impressive, and contributed significantly to my own learning and the completion of our Little Shop project. A few that stood out in particular for me are:
* Positive mindset in the face of uncertainty and or challenge. Throughout the project, Susi was a wellspring of positivity.
* Emotional intelligence evidenced by her ability to read other's feelings and show empathy and compassion.
* Humor, which makes pairing with her a pleasure."

"On the technical side, Susi is highly proficient with html, css, and Bootstrap. She single handedly implemented a controller refactor that employed our project's only module. She also paired on multiple difficult challenges including order creation, photo upload, review editing, and authentication."
###### Area of growth
"In terms of an area of growth, I would challenge Susi to continue to push herself to drive during pairing sessions and aggressively seek opportunities to solo implementation."

From **David Davydov**: "Susi is a very talented programmer and human being. She is funny, kind, and always knows the right thing to say. Having her in our group was a breath of fresh air, and whether we were reviewing code with the rest of our group, or pairing, working with Susi was always pleasant. Susi has a knack for caring about people. She would always be genuinely interested in how I was doing, and I always appreciated her kindness and willingness to make sure I was alright. From the get-go, Susi was determined to have a strong impact on the project. On day one, she committed to doing the site’s wireframes and had them ready the next day. Every day Susi made herself available during the day, evening, and even some nights for screenhero pairing. Susie’s commitment to the team, her never-slowing performance, and her compassion make her a fun and energetic teammate to work with."

## D: Professional Skills
One of the things I am most proud of when it comes to Turing is the fact that we are not being trained and educated solely in programming; we are also being taught how to function as a Software Developer in the workplace once we graduate. Turing shows us how to look at ourselves holistically rather than just technically. With the Friday Gear Up Sessions, classes with Lia, and sessions with Allison, we consistently work on the soft skills necessary to be efficient, productive, and well rounded Software Developers.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This session was extremely helpful in allowing me to look within myself at how I learn and how I process information. I have a hard time, sometimes, with breaking problems down into the smallest pieces possible. Kathy Sierra spoke about our brains being saturated and at times, well most times, at Turing this is the case. We, as students, do not have a ton of time to allow difficult concepts to sink into our brains. This is something I am actively work on: giving my mind a bit of space to let difficult concepts and ideas settle in. What I have noticed by doing this, is that I am able to ask better questions of my teachers and classmates the next day, or even a few days later. I also realized from the video and article that I am a definite creature of habit and repetition is my friend because if that. The more reps I can get in of a complex theory, code base, idea, etc... the more I will truly understand and appreciate it.

#### There is an I in Team
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This session was surprising to me - in a very good way. I was not sure at all how talking about my belief or disbelief in ghosts was going to get me anywhere, but I was pleasantly surprised. By having at least 3 different opinions in our group, we were able to talk about WHY this conversation about ghosts did actually apply to development teams.

#### Decoding the Gender Gap
* [Original Gear Up Outline](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This movie was incredible. Absolutely incredible. I was shocked to hear the story of the female engineer who left GitHub and was publicly humiliated for her work there after the fact. I was touched by our small group discussion afterwards when we were able to safely share stories of personal experiences. Even more impactful to me was the fact that we had a few men in our group who were there to ask the women questions about our experiences in an effort to understand what this movie was truly about for us. Our community will be an even stronger community if this movie spurs more discussions between students, faculty, staff, and the outside community.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Building our Brand & Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Potential Places for me To Reach Out To](https://gist.github.com/susiirwin/b61b429da6ec18afd420ea950fd6d45a)

This session was incredibly informative. Lia walked us through the proper setups for all of our social media accounts as well as our professional accounts. She was able to give us tips and advice for having effective, truthful. and rich descriptions within our profiles. She encouraged us to really put the thought and effort that is necessary into these profiles as well; these accounts and profiles can really help propel us forward and we need to take them seriously. Lia really stressed to all of us how important our "Story" is in the hiring process; she helped us think about Who We Are, How We Got Here, and What We Want to be Doing Next. I know now that my story includes all aspects of me - not just me as a Software Developer.

#### Small Group Feedback Session with Allison

This session occurred at a critical time in our Module. Allison spoke to us about writing and providing critical, constructive, and actionable feedback for each other. On top of that, she also spoke to us about what we need to do with that feedback when we receive it. I have used this session already when I have been providing feedback for my teams and other members of the community. It is a challenging thing to do, and I still need more practice, but I feel like each piece of feedback I am providing is one step closer to being strong feedback.

#### Collaboration Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

  In Rush Hour the team I worked with used an approach that was a hybrid of waterfall and agile, with emphasis on agile. We did not utilize our Waffle as much as I had hoped, but we did make a solid attempt. The Project Spec was our main source for user stories and tasks. This project was very difficult to divide and conquer so the three of us worked together most of the time. Due to this three person work sessions, we were able to really move through the spec sheet as one team. Our communication was decent, but at times was fairly surface deep. We were not as specific in our feedback as we should have been and this caused some tension. We learned from our feedback session with Allison afterwards that more specific feedback would have been extremely beneficial to the team's communication and mood.

  For Little Shop, we used a fairly strict agile workflow and this really worked out well. We also made a solid effort, and succeeded, in putting comments into GitHub and taking each other within those comments.

2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

  I have used this feedback in many ways. One thing I have done is started asking even more questions if I am unclear of why a teammate, partner, cohort-mate is doing something that I just do not understand. I have become a bit more assertive in my approach to people as well and have started offering more detailed feedback which includes clear examples for that person. I have learned that I am a bit too quiet when I am unclear during a project and have started to change that by vocalizing my concerns and questions. I have also started to experiment more with my code by using Pry and ByeBug more frequently.

#### Networking with Lia

This was one of my favorite sessions of the series. It was amazing to practice our networking skills with cohort-mates. I received some truly great feedback on my story and have already worked on it quite a bit. It was a really encouraging session and Lia really energized the class with her anecdotes and advice. She made me feel like I was on a great path moving forward and that I could network easily and naturally. She offered us some great tips on how to keep conversations flowing naturally and easily as well as great ways to end conversations.

#### Pairing with Kerry

This module I paired with Kerry Sheldon every Friday morning; however, this pairing session was not a technical pairing - it was a soft skills and professional skills pairing session. Kerry worked with me on communication skills, feedback skills, active listening skills, and interpersonal skills. We spoke about dealing with stress, anxiety, and confidence levels.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback pertaining to Rush Hour:
  To **Nate Andersen**: "Your calm demeanor and analytical thought process made this project way more enjoyable to work on. You were always there to cheer us on, say positive recognition, and make sure that we kept the end goal in mind. Your Iteration 2 method work was a HUGE breakthrough for our team and our project and seeing you smile when you figured out the rankings of top 3 items was awesome. In the future, I would love to hear you speak up even more and really get your thoughts on the tough spots."

  To **Bryan Goss**: "I am so thankful I was able to ask you questions when I didn’t understand what was happening. You are very dedicated to the project and to the team and that really shows in your intensity and determination.  To be perfectly honest I was really intimidated when I heard we were going to be on the same team; you have such an amazing handle on the code and databases that it can be a bit overwhelming.  What I realized was that having you as a team member is great! You have the ability to explain areas that were confusing to me. I would urge you to not put so much pressure on yourself to be done first, or compare the status of one groups’s project to the one you are working on. Keep staying dedicated and passionate and keep up that sense of humor! The laughs you created were incredible. Watching you work through SQL statements was great; your thought process and process of elimination is commendable."

#### Feedback pertaining to Little Shop Of Orders:

To **Sonia Gupta**: "Sonia's passion and commitment to our project, to learning, and to her classmates is incredible. Her collaboration skills are inspiring and working with her in both a group and a pair setting has been such a great experience. She has no fear with just getting her hands into the code and trying something out. Sonia taught me that sometimes the best way to think through a complicated problem is just write some code and see what happens! She is an code-experimenter and it is awesome! If I could offer Sonia one point to work on it would be to work on articulating herself when her frustration starts to kick in. There was one moment during Little Shop where a hidden application file would not show up on her computer and she was getting a bit stressed out about it. I would urge her to not be so hard on herself when things get a little off track. Sonia is so talented and I am just thrilled that I finally got to work alongside her!"

To **Jesse Spevack**: "Jesse is a natural leader, organizer, and developer. His troubleshooting and problem solving skills are among some of the best I have ever seen. His attention to detail and desire to succeed is stunning. During Little Shop Jesse was our fearless Project Manager; he never hesitated to help our group come to a decision and always urged us to try to do more than we believed we could. His desire to succeed, although inspiring, can also be a bit intimidating. This was evident in his successful efforts to style buttons on a few pages in Little Shop with icons. Thought this determination is admirable, it can also be frustrating to team members. That being said, Jesse is inspirational and has taught me a lot during our two week project. I am a lucky person to be placed on his team. Thanks for everything, Jesse!"

To **David Davydov**: "David is a hidden gem in our cohort. He is so quiet and reserved, but I learned pretty quickly that all that quietness is just because he is always thinking a few steps ahead. His ability to calmly and carefully work through an issue is great. David is amazing at Git Workflow - specifically on Merge Conflicts. His calm way of reading through the errors and conflicts that makes the repair of the conflicts seem painless. David was an amazing group and pairing partner. I would encourage David to speak up when he sees or hears something that does not sit quite right with him. There were a few moments during the project where he would speak up about a point of confusion or contention within the group, but since it seemed he was thinking on and about it for awhile, his tone was a bit abrasive. His ideas and solutions for these problems were spot on just about every time, but the impact of the delivery can sometimes be challenging. David really understands the code and the projects. He is super determined and extremely talented. I am so excited that I finally got to work with him and get to know him better."

#### Community Member Feedback
To **Andy Young**: "Andy is such an amazing asset to this community. I was privileged to co-lead Imposters with Andy and I have learned so much from him. His life experiences surprise me every time I speak with him. If I could encourage Andy to work on one thing it would be his level of confidence in himself. He is such an incredible person and I can see him going so far in his career. I am honored to call him a colleague and friend."

To **Tommasina Miller**: "It has been such a pleasure to be a part of Pahlka Posse with Tommasina this module. She has stepped up as co-leader of our group and it has made a huge impact on the posse. Her passion for civic tech, social justice, and life in general makes her an amazing fit for this Posse as well as Turing. Her enthusiasm mixed with her gentle voice and demeanor make her a dream to work alongside. She has an amazing way of bringing people together, being an active listener, and a natural organizer. I would love see Tommasina run a Student Led Session or facilitate a gear-up; her natural way of teaching makes her an incredible fit for these roles.""

To **Ryan Workman**: "Ryan is a backbone of our Module. His enthusiasm, passion for helping others succeed, and absolute unending curiosity is unreal. I have paired with Ryan on multiple occasions over the course of 2 modules. He is the first to tell me to be brave and just try something in my code. He is the first to remind me that no matter what, I am capable of anything. Ryan's participation with SAB this module has only further cemented his passion for Turing, our community, and his learning. He has co-run our retros every week and just shines in this role. He loves his module, his work, his community, and his friends. At times his enthusiasm does get the best of him and the curiosity that fuels his learning also leads him astray of the requirements in a spec. If he can direct his passion into staying on track with the spec he will go even further than he already has. Ryan comes up with ways to solve problems that are just mind-blowing. On multiple occasions I have asked him, "how the heck does your mind work??" I would consider myself amazingly lucky to be half as supportive and passionate as Ryan."

To **Kris Sparks**: "Kris is an unsung hero at Turing. He does more behind the scenes than anyone really knows. Not only does he help keep the space clean, tidy, and organized, he also reaches out to students constantly. He is always happy to help, offer a second set of eyes on a piece of code, or just talk through a complicated problem. It is people like Kris that make Turing what it is."

To **Erin Pintozzi**: "Erin has been an active member of the Imposters group module and with that has been a huge support for me as well as fellow group members. Her encouraging and attitude is infectious! She brings thoughtful and helpful comments to the group and always makes people feel welcome and appreciated. I hope to see her step forward in coming modules as a leader of this group so that her vast past experiences and all around wonderfulness can be even more appreciated. She is an asset to our community and I cannot wait to see how her journey as a software developer unfolds."


### Being a Community Member

From **Ryan Workman**: "It's rare that you come across someone as motivated and relentless as you, Susi.  As you know, you have a been helping me all Module.  Your words of encouragement and constant reminders that the rules matter have made me a better coder.  Overall, I think it would pay-off ten-fold if you turned that motivation and confidence inward.  I can honestly tell you that you are much better at writing code and problem solving than I am, but your fear of making mistakes holds you back from experimenting and unlocking the shear power of coding.  As I always tell you, remember what Miss Frizzle says, "Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!"  You have the ability and the potential to become one of the best in the biz, and I can't wait until you see it."

From **Erin Pintozzi**: "Susi, I don't even know where to begin. I have so thoroughly enjoyed meeting you this module. Between the Joan Clarke coffee mornings and Imposter's Lunches, I feel like I learned so much from you and how to be a great mod 1 student (and hopefully future developer!). You have offered great advice for handling my uncertainties about my skills and how to handle nervousness and anxiety around assessments. I feel very lucky to have met you. I hope you continue to be awesome and find ways to reach out to those who need and appreciate the insight you have to offer.   If I can provide even half as much support to future students as I feel I've gotten from you over the last 6 weeks, I would count myself lucky."

From **Eric Wahlgren-Suro**: "The imposters lunches since week one have given me great comfort in knowing that I’m not alone in this death march to coding success. Before I had my final  assessment for this module, Susi reminded me of familiar techniques to stay calm during the assessment. Although I did not pass my assessment her reminding me to voice my anxiety to Beth made me feel less alone as I worked through the material."

From **Dave Junta**: "Susi has been an amazing presence at Turing for a lot of people in Mod 1, especially in the Imposters group.  She brings a humility and warmth to a program that can feel, despite all the great people, quite brutal.  Her sharing of her own experiences, both good and bad, has been a great source of support for fellow Imposters like myself.  Lastly, I’m always amazed but not surprised how everyone, even those not in Imposters, seems to know and love her."

### Playing a Part

This Module was a very busy one for me. I stepped up in the Pahlka Posse and took over the Student Support Survey each week where Posse members can ask for an extra pairing. This has been extremely interesting for me and has given me a huge opportunity to really get to know the members of my posse and our Mentors better. I love that the Pahlka Posse is so supportive - both as a mission but also as a group of students. We have a set of incredible mentors as well. I have learned to be an active listener and I Know that will help mw in my professional career.

My mentor is Matt Rogers. We slack almost everyday and make a point to Facetime about once a week. He is there for me for technical questions, professional questions, but also general questions about life as a developer. He is just wonderful!

I have been an active member of the Joan Clarke Society on Slack as well as the Tuesday morning Coffee group. I created a "Parenturing" channel on Slack to connect the students  and staff at Turing who are also raising children. This has made a huge impact on me and has brought me closer to other students and staff. I have found that I can reach out to this sub-community for more support and also for amazingly cute pictures of our children! I am an active member of the Turing-Moms channel where I help support other Moms in the community as well as receive a ton of support.

I, along with Andy Young of 1606-FE, have taken over as co-leader running the Imposter Lunch sessions on Wednesdays. I learned so much from being a member of this group in my first Module that I wanted to step up and help other students as well. This has been extremely challenging and also extremely rewarding. I have enjoyed this weekly get together very much and look forward to continuing it throughout my time at Turing.

I volunteered to help with updating the student, staff, and faculty photos this module. Kris Sparks has been working on this and asked for some assistance. It was a bigger job than I anticipated but the rewards were even larger; I learned the names of almost every single Module 1 student in both programs. It was incredible.

I took the feedback I received from Jeff in my Module 1 assessment to pair with Kerry Sheldon weekly on professional skills, communication skills, and soft skills. She and I met every Friday morning for about 45 minutes to talk about the areas in my non-coding realm of learning. I also met with a student weekly who took time off between Module 1 and repeating Module 1. We spoke about the work he was doing outside of Turing to prepare him for repeating the Module. We had many discussions about strengths and weaknesses for both of us and strategies for dealing with the stress of Turing. I was able to show him how I was applying what I had learned in Module 1 to my Module 2 work and where I was pushing myself further in this module than I expected.

Every week I attended  guest speaker sessions and also helped to rearrange the room for those sessions.

This module I volunteered to be a Pre-Work Guide for an incoming 1610BE student. It has been really great to be on the other side of that pair and be able to offer some advice and help to an incoming student. I have really enjoyed it and hope to do it again next module.
