### Areas of Emphasis

I think it is undeniable that my main area of emphasis for module 4 is to prove to myself that I can do this... I love coding and I love the challenges it represents, and although I do not want to be a software developer for the rest of my life (I really want to be a Product/Project Manager), I now have a great sense of admiration for coding and coders. My goal for module four as far as technical skills, was definitely to get as much exposure as possible to JS and REACTJS, and I think I have accomplished it thanks to the curriculum that the staff has put together.

### A: End of Module Assessment

_FEEDBACK NOTES_

- Missing partial functionality from 4 and 5
- Missing any testing for create and edit link. Expecting controller tests.
- Javascript is kind of verbose, but it shows troubleshooting and problem solving
- ^^^ The above things have been addressed and corrected 

_EVAL NOTES_

### 1. Satisfactory Progress
* **3: Developer completes sections 1 through 5 minor bugs and no missing functionality.**

### 2. Ruby & Rails Style & API
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 3. Javascript Syntax & Style
* **3: Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**

### 4. Testing
* **3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design. Developer uses integration tests, controller tests, and model tests where appropriate.**

### 5. User Interface
* **3: The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality**

### 6. Workflow
* **4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.**

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Open Source (with Jesse)

We collaborated to Lovisa's CREACT Tutorial. It was not only fun to do it, but the great feedback we received from her, and I am looking forward to keep collaborating to the tutorial as we receive more and more feedback.

### Enroll

* [Enroll GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/enroll)
* [Enroll Staging](http://enroll-staging.turing.io)
* [Apply Staging](http://apply-staging.turing.io/)

### Capstone Project

This was a six weeks long project, our cohort was split up into three teams with different projects, two of which were meant to communicate with each other. I personally worked on the Enroll team, which was an active enrollment app for Turing students. We were asked to implement new features as well as modify current functionalities so that it could integrate with its sister project aka Census.

The main features I have made contributions are `Smart Search`, `Testing Suites`, and last but not list the initial communication between Enroll and Census.  

### Enroll

`Enroll` is an enrollment app for new students. They must register through `Apply`, an authentication service, before gaining access to Enroll. Future iterations will have Enroll speak to Census to do the authentication side of it (instead of Apply).

_FEEDBACK NOTES_

I'll just ramble for a while. I've decided that you were given some above average difficulty, but not impossible tasks. Everyone complains about Josh Cheek's code, but I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility of things you'll find, especially in the open source world. I've found that gems and libraries are written by people that are just coding all the time, and they need to keep themselves interested.

The real struggle that I stepped into was process. Our goal was to simulate how projects are really done in the working world, and your process was holding you back. Communication between the different roles on the team, staff and student, was broken. People didn't know what others were thinking, how to get their questions across, or how to communicate progress and blockers. I can't say who's fault that is, but I'm big on personal responsibility, so I'll just say it was everyone's fault.

There are actually still improvements to be made to our communication and workflow. With all that said, I went back into manager mode, and I was strict about deliverables and adherence to the workflow I've communicated, and you guys bounced back quickly. I want you to ramp up even more in the last two weeks of the project, but I'm proud of what you delivered this week and how you delivered it. You're making lasting impact on your own careers, and the cogs that make Turing run.

_EVAL SCORES_

### 1. Project Management
* **4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily.**

### 2. Completion & Pace
* **3: Team is on track to complete all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.**

### 3. Implementation Quality
* **3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.**

### 4. Application of Techniques
* **3: Project has implemented one major technique from the previous two weeks of academic classes.**

_PEERS FEEDBACK_

**From Sonia** Feedback to Raphael Barbo: I think Rapha and I would both agree that we've learned a lot from each other about our own working and communication styles. He is the consummate professional, and I appreciate that he has been receptive to feedback. He brings a gentle positivity to every endeavor, and has put in a lot of effort on this project. I'm glad to know him, and have learned a lot about how I can improve myself not only as a programmer, but as a human.


**From Brian H.** I have worked with Rapha before and it is always great to work with him. He and I work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair. Unfortunately I only got to work with Rapha for one afternoon on this project, but it was on a cool feature: the smart search, and was very rewarding. Rapha is a strong coder and has a relentless motor; he is always hungry for more code and new things to try. I look forward to seeing what he can accomplish after we leave Turing.


**From Jean** Feedback for Raphael Barbo: Rapha is wonderful to work with. When pairing he is happy to let people try a solution, but has no problem questioning the solution. His happy, laid back attitude makes it easy to pair with him, even in stressful situations. He essential to creating smart search, and continued to work on it with David on a day I had to leave. This is my second project working with Rapha, and both times he has been an excellent team member

**From David** Raphael has matured a lot during his time at Turing, particularly in the way he approaches a group project. Not only is he a very dependable and hard working programmer, he is also light and keeps things fun. I can honestly say that it has always been a blast to work with you Raphael. You are the kind of guy I'd like to work with in the real world.

## D: Professional Skills

### Deliverables
#### Flower Exercise Follow-Up Paragraphs

##### 1-2 paragraphs describing your perceived barriers and the action steps you will take to overcome them

> I often time hesitate to apply for jobs because of the qualifications required, and one of the biggest changes I have noticed on myself is that I am looking at them from a different perspective. "Yeah I am not have all the qualifications, but I sure as heck can learn anything", and that has opened up some doors and interviews recently.

##### 1 paragraph describing my top 3 priorities in my first dev job and why

> I think as far as my first job goes, one of my top priorities is definitely the size of the company that I will be working for. I’ve worked at companies that were smaller and although I appreciated the experience I've learned that is not quite my thing. As a junior developer I am looking for mentorship above anything else.My second priority is definitely staying in Colorado, my wife and I moved here December 2015 and I since she was born and raise in Boulder, we would like to stay around the area (or should I say it is not an option to move anywhere else). Last but def not least important is benefits over salary, I would much rather work for a company with great benefits rather than getting paid big bucks (of course I know what I am worth) but still benefits are important for me since I am planning on having a family sometime next year.

### Six Cold Outreach Emails 

1. **Chelsea Worrel | Octvi** - I wanted to get in touch about her company (since I am interested in applying for a position when they have an opening), and know more about her job search experience and any hints she could possibly give me.

2. **Kyle Henson| Huron** - Kyle Henson is a software developer at My Rounding Solutions, I contacted via LinkedIn (week 2) and followed up during week 3 about a job application I had submitted for Junior PM position at Huron. 

3. **Jim Ray | CaptainU** - I had spoken with him before, and we talked about getting in touch once I was getting closer to graduate. He has agreed to grab coffee some time during our break week (between Christmas and New Year), he will look over my resume, and give me some ideas on how approach job search and opportunities.

4. **Ian Douglas | Stream** - I had three pairing sessions with Ian @ Stream. The first was a casual (informal) lunch in Boulder to go over resume, connecting with people in the industry,etc... The second and third one was working on a Ruby application they needed help with at GetStream. It was a great experience to get to work in a real world code-base and see the challenges that it entails.

5. **Linda Hall | Leprino Foods** - I sent cold email to Linda at the beginning of December about a position of Web Developer they had open at their company. One week later I received an email from her asking me if I would be interested in coming in for an interview and learn more about their company and the department. Although I loved the company, its technology is not in par with the current market (most WordPress | PHP stuff) and I did not believe I would be a good fit for the company at this time.

6. **Mark Evans | SnapTeam** - I sent Mark a cold outreach email at the beginning of Module 4. He was super welcoming and easy to talk to. Mark has given a lot great advises on how to approach the job search and technical interviews (he is a G2 grad), and he even opened up an opportunity for me to interview with his company in Boulder.

### Gear Up

**Microagressions** - [GIST](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_group1.md)

I know this Gear Up caused some interesting and somewhat coincidental drama, I really appreciated how receptive some of my peers were to letting others talk about their personal microagression stories. I do wish there was a finer line drawn between instances that are overtly racist and those that are microagressive-- it seemed like some of the articles we read had a mix of both. Neither are good things, obviously, but I think they socially have very different connotations and impacts on people.

**Journey Mapping** - [GIST](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/journey-mapping.markdown)

This Gear Up seemed to be a very practical one for the developer real world post Turing. Thinking about users and what keeps them engaged and happy is a very important skill that most developers I've worked with in the past as a project manager lacked. This showed us a concrete way to empathize with users AKA people that use and hopefully benefit from our applications.

**Grit Mindset** - [GIST](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)

This was a great session with Jeff... Although I find it very interesting, I wonder how one measures their level of grit? As someone who hasn't had too many opinions but hustle in life, I wonder how one differentiates dedication vs. necessity. Anyhow, it was a great talk and discussion for sure.

## F: Feedback & Community Participation

### Helping Modules 2 & 3

- Provided some assistance to students from previous modules, whether on a project that they were working on, or just a clarification. 

### Giving Feedback

**To Brian H.** It is always a pleasure working with Brian, he brings such a positive attitude and great energy and I absolutely love it. He is always cheerful and has such a great attitude towards everything and everyone. During our pairing session throughout this project, Brian was able to break down problems into small manageable partitions, explain the process, and make sure we both understood what was going on in the code base. Brian and I both work well together and contribute code harmoniously when we pair, and that for me is just an amazing treat.
I absolutely love working with Brian... Can't wait to see where his coding skills take him.

**Sonia** I can certainly say that having Sonia in the Enroll throughout the module has been such a treat to all of us. She adds more than just knowledge to the group and it is always refreshing to hear her point of views about some of the logical problems we were going through during the project. Sonia and I have paired quite a few times throughout our time at Turing, and I can certainly say that we have overcome quite a few hurdles (mainly due to our personalities) and this willingness that we both bring to the table, to always work together and improve ourselves for the sake of becoming a better human being and professional, has definitely brought us closer this module. 
I know she will go great things in the future, and I can't wait to see what her coding life takes her.

**Jean** Working with Jean is such a treat, I love how he can approach a problem from so many different perspectives and still come up with a great, reasonable, and easy to understand the solution. 
I am a big fan of Jean and I absolutely love working with him. He easy-going attitude towards challenges, and resilience to overcome obstacles, and above all his patience and willingness to learn and grow is something I truly and sincerely admire about him. 
Jean is a great human being all around, I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with Jean on two separate projects. I have learned a ton from you and I can't wait to see what the future holds. I know I will see you accomplish some really amazing things.

**David** Working with David throughout my time at Turing has been one of the most rewarding and fun experiences. I have learned a lot from him, and I am glad we have been able to share those experiences with each other. He gives me a sense of ease, and it allows me to work in a much more relaxed and stress free way. I love pairing with him because I never feel judged and I feel like we both contribute a lot to each other's way of working. He is in my opinion one of the most technical savvy classmates I have, and I am glad I shared this experience with him. Can't wait to see what the future holds for you David, surely amazing things are about to come your way !

**To Susi** Susi is one of the most resilient and self-motivated people I have had the opportunity to work with. Her dedication throughout her time at Turing has been nothing short of remarkable, and it has paid off big time. Susi has certainly become a great software developer, and I am glad to have been able to share this journey with her. 

### Receiving Feedback

**From Susi**   "Rapha has always been one to stop, listen, and check in with me. He has been a constant supporter of every student at Turing whom he has come in contact with. His positive attitude and cheery mood is not to be missed around Turing! Rapha keeps his head on his shoulders but dreams big - in his code and in life in general. I am so excited to see where Rapha takes his talent and the applications that he will develop."
