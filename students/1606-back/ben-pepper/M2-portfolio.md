## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Repeating Mod 2 meant that I needed to step up and figure out more about ActiveRecord and Rails. My biggest goal is to really understand ActiveRecord as best I can before getting into Mod 3.  I am actually not going to focus as much on pairing with Mod 1 and instead focus more on myself, per Sal's suggestion from my portfolio review.

### End of Module Assessment

####1. Conceptual Understanding

 * 3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

####2. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

 * 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them with little assistance

####3. Feature Completeness

 * 4: Developer is able to finish all prescribed functionality, refactor and have all passing tests

####4. ActiveRecord Syntax and Style

 * 3: Developer is able to establish and utilize ActiveRecord methods with minimal support and understands the relationship between models and the database

####5. Rails Style

 * 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

####6. Testing

 * 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development, but may need some assistance parsing errors or prioritizing next steps

####7. Collaboration

 * 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### Work

#### (Project Name)

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/bfpepper/Mix-Master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master had us design a Rials project for adding songs and artists to a given playlist and then tie in the Spotify API. We had to create our own routes and views which gave me a better understanding of how Rails functions.

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/bfpepper/idea-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea box was a quick Rails 5 mini project that was designed to give us a crash course in Rails CRUD before starting Little Shop.  I wanted to focus more on Authorization and Authentication in this project and that is where I spent my time. I knew that I would be getting more experience with routes, view, partials, etc, so I wanted to make sure I understood the security side of Rails better.

* [Job Tracker](https://github.com/bfpepper/job-tracker)
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/bfpepper/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was a fun app to work on. We were able to create a full rails app that we can end up using for our job search from Mod 3 on. This second rials app gave me more time with the material and made it more comfortable to go into Little Shop. This was a great addition to the material and I think it will help many students along the way.

####1) Database, Relationships, and Migrations

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.

####2) Routes

3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.

####3) Controllers

3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.

####4) ActiveRecord

3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.

####5) Views

3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.

####6) User Experience

4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.

####7) Testing

2: Project has sporadic use of tests and multiple levels

## Team

### Projects

Our team projects gave us time to not only dive deeper into Sinatra and Rails but also to to work more in teams to simulate the real world. These were both valuable projects to learn more about how Sinatra doesn't have al the "magic" of Rails but also how Sinatra is far more lightweight and customizable than Rails.

#### (Project Name)

* [Rush Hour](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush hour was designed to be a web traffic information parser. The idea was to take in raw JSON from a client and then parse it and display it in a meaningful way. This way the client could understand what info users were accessing and how their servers were functioning.


####Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills base expectations

####Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

####Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

####Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

####Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

####View Layer
3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

####Workflow (NOT GRADED)

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

* [Little Shop](https://github.com/bfpepper/little-shop-1608)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)


Little shop was our first real Rails project. It required us to build an e-commerce site.  This included having authenticated users, admins, carts, etc. This was my first project at Turing where I felt I could sink my teeth into the material. This was were everything came together and it was something I could show to people. I loved doing the OAuth as an extension and was beyond excited when it worked on Heroku. This has been my most favorite project because it also tied in user stories and it made it more appealing to deal with those as opposed to iterations.

###Professional Skills

####Gear up

These Gear Ups caused more introspection then I think I have done in the past. The voting gear up was interesting to listen to people's thoughts on the election and voting in general. The resilience talk was also interesting. I learned that I don't always have the most popular opinion and that that can lead to interesting exchanges and discussions. As yet again, Gear Ups always are able to pull interesting ideas out of seemingly simple topics.

####Cold Email

Matt,

Rachel Sinclair, who manages the volunteer services, gave me your email as someone who does software development for the Denver Art Museum.

I would love to learn more about what code base you use for the DAM and any interesting projects you may be working on currently. The DAM has been doing such fantastic events recently and I would be interested in in hearing so of what you have experienced working there.

Would you be able to meet for coffee Amethyst Coffee on Friday, November 4th at 1pm.

Best,

Ben Pepper

####Reflection
For Rush Hour our team mostly paired for everything. I know this worked well for my partners but it left me a little anxious to get more done on my own. During out retro we discussed this aspect and agreed that I needed to be more vocal about what I needed from a group. We used Waffel to keep track of features, cards, and general flow of the project which was nice and quite beneficial. I think we would have been better served with a bit more dividing the project up.

The feedback I got from my Rush Hour group played heavily in my DTR with my Little Shop group. Because I learned that I needed to divide a project I was able to accurately communicate that to my group and I was able to still contribute without holding anyone else up. Learning that about myself from Rush Hour was huge and it meant that I have more tools to go into future projects here at Turing and in the industry at large.

## Community

Ben was a great partner. He was very open to answering questions and trying new things. Ben was also incredibly open to feedback and appreciated honesty. We probably could have been a little more clear with each other about our preferred working styles, but we all realized that and agreed to take note going forward.  I was happy to have him as a partner!

-Lee Saville
Ben I love how eager you are to get things to work. In the future you could perhaps be more aware of your strong inclination towards divide and conquer and communicate that more clearly in your dtrs. In addition, sometimes it seemed like your frustration with not having the answer right away prevented you from moving forward on a problem, It’d be great to see you harness that eagerness to solve problems and not let not having the answer slow you down. You’ve definitely inspired me to try and become more comfortable with divide and conquer in the future and it was great working with you!   

-Joey Stansfield
Ben, it’s been a good week and a half working on little shop together. You did an excellent job as project manager. That took some of the logistical stresses off the rest of us and made it easier to focus on problem solving. Everything fit together seamlessly and much of that should be attributed to your management. I have one suggestion for the next time you find yourself in a project management role: create some sort of style guide. Our test naming is pretty inconsistent. Our routes were a bit messy (but have since been refactored). I think some of these things could have been made cleaner if we had outlined a guide in the beginning. This is never something I would have predicted, but something I learned entirely in this project. Overall great job as a manager and team member. Nice work on oauth and google maps. I’d be happy to work with you again.

- Anthony Ciccone
Really relaxed and easy to work with. Ben was really helpful with our github workflow. He was often the one check over pull requests and push our work to master. Ben also looked into pulling google maps into our project which was a great addition.

- Ryan Travitz
I appreciated that you took over the project manager tasks for this project. You set the tone for our workflow early on, and as a result we had an easy time working as a team. Our workflow made me feel like a real developer and was a highlight of the project for me. I also appreciated your constant positivity and reassurances. Thank you!


### Giving Feedback

- To Megan Talbot
Megan was a great project manager. Her attention to detail made sure that we always completely finished an iteration before moving on. Her drive to fully understand a problem was instrumental in the group learning as much as possible. Our working styles were not in sync but during our retro she was extremely professional in bringing it up and discussing it. She made it easy to understand what happened and her thoughts on how to move forward. I learned a lot from her about how to work more effectively in a group and it will only prove to be helpful through out Turing.

- To Lee Saville
Lee is an extremely energetic and inquisitive partner to have in any group. His tenacity in finding answers in amazing and inspiring. During our retro he was extremely professional and made it easy to discuss what went I needed to work on in the future. His desire to learn as much as possible is extremely valuable. I would suggest that sometime it is not imperative to learn the intricacies of a system to implement it. Trying to learn the code base, though valuable, may lead down rabbit holes that may not serve the groups direction or time frame. I think when we talked about time boxing tangents it was helpful. I think that continuing that is extremely helpful in any group or individual endeavor.  Lee is always positive and will always bring so much to any group he is part of.

- To Joey Stansfield
Joey is an amazing partner to work with. His ability to quickly, and efficiently complete any task that is handed to him is amazing. Every day he would come in with some new functionality that was well thought out and executed beautifully. He did a fantastic job of integrating JavaScript into the project to get added functionality.  This addition made our Little Shop so much more professional and something that I am excited to show people. I would be thrilled to have Joey as a partner again either in Turing or in the work force.

- To Anthony Ciccone
Anthony was a work horse during Little shop. He was always willing to take on a card and make any changes necessary. He was extremely easy to pair with and always brought fantastic ideas to the table. He has great attention to detail and I am sure he will be fantastic through out the rest of Turing and in the workforce.

- To Ryan Travitz
Ryan was our details and styling guru. His attention to detail can not be matched. He was always able and willing to make sure that everything was perfect before we moved onto the next card/feature/or problem. He was awesome to pair with and was always able to have a different point of view that helped me understand the problem better. Ryan has a tenacity that I dont see often and it was amazing watching him tackle a problem or see a PR submitted late into the night on something he just HAD to figure out. Our Little Shop would not have been nearly as amazing without his contributions and workflow.


### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

- One Friday guest talk (How cool was that!)
- 3 pairings with Mod 1
- 1 student led panel

This Module I was less focused on the community aspect. I wanted to focus more on my learning in order to facilitate my transition to Mod 3. However, I did pair a few times with Mike in Mod 1 to help him with his mid module assessment. I was also able to lead a Friday talk about Tesla and show everyone what we are able to do as devs. I also volunteered to lead the student panel for Hello Turing.
