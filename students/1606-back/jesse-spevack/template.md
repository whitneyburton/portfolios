### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to complete every project with a score of three or higher in every category. I focused on test driven development (tdd) and object oriented programming. I focused on writing rigorously tested clean code. I worked to break problems down into smaller and more fundamental components in order to complete larger projects.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

I completed the following projects: Robodoku, CompleteMe, ParaMorse, Battleship, and Black Thursday.

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/roboduko)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/robodoku-template)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/2/75u8n0im73hd27a4yclc98qzl6hivu)

##### Description
Roboduko is about writing a sudoku solving program that takes in a simple sudoku puzzle as a .txt file and outputs the resulting solved puzzle as text.

This project was not formally assessed.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/planetefficacy/CompleteMe)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/5/turing-school-of-software-design-module-1-week-2)

##### Description
CompleteMe is a rudimentary autocomplete program that first loads in a dictionary of words and then can take in a prefix and return words from the dictionary that begin with the prefix. The project gets a little spicier with the notion of weighted suggestions whereby the program needs to also store the user's preferences regarding a given prefix so that next time that prefix is given, the user's past selected words are prioritized over other words.

### Giving Feedback
Jasmin Hudacsek: I got to work extensively with Jasmin during the Black Thursday project. She has some phenomenal strengths that need to be shouted out. First, she is highly organized. She can keep track of many streams of information and responsibilities. She has systems in place for making sure that nothing is overlooked including a comprehensive Trello board. Second, she has strong interpersonal skills. She communicates clearly both in person and in writing. A significant portion of our collaboration was carried out asynchronously through Slack. It was always clear what she was working on. Third, Jasmin has a strong level attention to detail in her code. Technically, Jasmin is extremely proficient with the git workflow and Waffle.io. For those reasons, it was a real gift to work with Jasmin on the final project of Module 1.
Moving forward, Jasmin would benefit from voicing concerns and dissenting opinions more directly and frequently. There were many times where I took a bizarre approach to a problem and Jasmin sort of assumed I knew what I was doing. We would have been better served if she had voiced her concerns, even if doing so would have had the immediate effect of slowing progress. More often than not, the gains from her careful thinking would far outweigh any short-term progress stoppages.
Overall, Jasmin was a fantastic partner and is a phenomenal cohort mate.

Brendan Dillon: What impresses me most about Brendan’s coding is his structural creativity. During a conversation about Battleship, Brendan explained that he intended to make each space a class. I thought this was a really creative solution that contributed significantly to the successful completion of my own project. During a second conversation about Black Thursday, Brendan discussed how he built multiple Analyst classes to help organize the code. I also took this idea and broke my own Sales Analyst into a set of modules and classes.

Bryan Goss: Bryan is outrageously generous with his time. He never shies away from answering a question or diving into someone else’s code even though we are all working to meet the same deadlines. He clearly has a very strong ability to break down complexity and then fit small ideas together to form elegant solutions to large problems. He freely shares this skillset with his fellow students.

Jean Joeris: Jean is highly analytical and takes a very scientific approach to TDD. His successful completion of the ParaMorse project rested on his ability to reframe problems for himself. He is also always willing to share his knowledge with his classmates. He also clearly is passionate about gender issues which is a welcome perspective in 1606.

Raphael Barbo: Raphael has incredible interpersonal skills. He has a very clear read on group dynamics and also has the ability to put himself in other people's shoes. I witnessed him recognize that a fellow student was upset after a code review, which I was oblivious to, and then move to show empathy and offer encouragement. He also clearly has some significant coding skill. Most recently, he helped me arrive at an approach to the Black Thursday project where repositories build themselves. It’s a real gift to have a guy like Raphael in the cohort.



### Being a Community Member
Jesse Spevack (Pair): Dream Team status! Working with Jesse on Black Thursday was an excellent learning opportunity in more ways than one. Not only is he a Google/Excel spreadsheet whiz, he’s also a stickler with TDD which are two things that I wish I were better at. Jesse led the charge in terms of highly-organized file structures and gorgeous tests. While working with him, I learned that he has high standards for himself, but he shouldn’t let those translate into unwarranted anxiety and pressure as often in the future. He’s extremely intelligent and talented with the crushing of the code, so he shouldn’t worry as much. I have no idea how he juggled all of the hours he spent on this project while also keeping up with his baby twins and wife, but we paired effectively together and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him.

Brendan Dillon: Whenever I talked about projects with Jesse, I was impressed by how methodical and organized his thinking was. Not only did he do some really great planning, but he also started discussions that encouraged other people to figure out how to plan and organize their projects. In the pairing exercises I did with Jesse, I found that he has a really sharp eye for detail and can debug code really well. On top of all this, he is pulling off a Herculean feat of work-life balance by raising newborn twins while attending Turing.

Jesse Spevack - "Jesse has an amazing personality, and inspiring attitude towards people, work and growth. Seeing how far Jesse has come in only 5 weeks of coding, is nothing far from impressive. I see Jesse as a natural born leader, who is caring, and extremely considered to other people. His ability to overcome challenges, and see the positive in every situation has inspired many of us in our cohort, and I will forever be thankful for having such an amazing human being in our 1606 cohort. Thank you - Raphael Barbo"
