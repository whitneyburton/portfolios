### Areas of Emphasis

With some prior knowledge of Ruby and general programming before Turing, I hoped to have a firmer grasp of Ruby fundementals in order to make complete and functioning programs. I also strived to better understand object-oriented programming and the best practices that go along with working with OOP. I was eager to learn as much as I could from instructors, mentors, and other students while I attend Turing.

Getting to meet some Turing alums before starting the program has made me fully aware that this will be the some of the hardest seven months of my life but also the most rewarding. I am both excited and nervous about making the commitment, but I know I will only become better for pulling through.

## Work

Projects from Module 1 teach the fundamentals of Ruby syntax. They became progressively more difficult but introduced new TDD and Agile development goals as the module progressed.

### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)
* [Project README](https://github.com/j-sm-n/flashcards/blob/master/README.md)

__Flashcards__ is a project that establishes an understanding of OOP and how objects can interact. The concepts of flashcards, a deck, and a round are used to show the capabilities of OOP.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Well tested, but could use some additional cases
* Great UI experience with Runner
* Some opportunities to refactor
* Look at ways to use calculated values instead of storing things in ivars
* two extensions

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## Team

### Projects

Paired projects in Module 1 focused on Git Workflow, pair programming methodologies and became increasingly more complex by the addition of parsing large CSV files.

### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/susiirwin/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project, systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse will be implemented.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Only converts to braille
* 10 tests
* Really clean code
* Braille to english does not write
* Some opportunities to refactor to improve testing by sending arguments as opposed to methods modifying ivars.
* Would like to see more edge cases in testing.
* Really like how you broke out the dictionary to a separate file and used constants
* Follows SRP exceptionally well, everything only does the one thing.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

##### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

>From Susi Irwin: "Jasmin was an absolute delight to partner with on Night Writer. Her strong organizational skills and motivated attitude pushed us forward at a fantastic rate. Jasmin is easy to communicate with in person, as well as remotely. I was excited to be paired with her for our first paired project and was not disappointed. She has an innate ability to calm nerves and logically look at the issues as they are presented. Jasmin was able to keep our motivation alive even when we hit bumps in the road. Her enthusiasm and charisma are absolutely wonderful!"

### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
* [DTR Memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EGVH93cjLdbbUTrYVOEmZZQxsFCdKb0_U8NeI-QwB-k/edit?usp=sharing)

__Black Thuesday__ is a project that focuses on using tests that both drive design and implementation of code, decomposes a large application into small components, connects related objects together through references and relies on an agile approach to building software.

(Evaluation Notes & Scores)

>From Jesse Spevek: "I got to work extensively with Jasmin during the Black Thursday project. She has some phenomenal strengths that need to be shouted out. First, she is highly organized. She can keep track of many streams of information and responsibilities. She has systems in place for making sure that nothing is overlooked including a comprehensive Trello board. Second, she has strong interpersonal skills. She communicates clearly both in person and in writing. A significant portion of our collaboration was carried out asynchronously through Slack. It was always clear what she was working on. Third, Jasmin has a strong level attention to detail in her code. Technically, Jasmin is extremely proficient with the git workflow and Waffle.io. For those reasons, it was a real gift to work with Jasmin on the final project of Module 1.

>Moving forward, Jasmin would benefit from voicing concerns and dissenting opinions more directly and frequently. There were many times where I took a bizarre approach to a problem and Jasmin sort of assumed I knew what I was doing. We would have been better served if she had voiced her concerns, even if doing so would have had the immediate effect of slowing progress. More often than not, the gains from her careful thinking would far outweigh any short-term progress stoppages.

>Overall, Jasmin was a fantastic partner and is a phenomenal cohort mate."

### Giving Feedback

>To Gabi Procell: Gabi has the BEST comebacks to silly remarks and is able to stay upbeat and calm even during times of stress. She’s been an awesome support system during our first module and I hope she has the chance to improve her confidence and speak up more when shit isn’t going as well as she’d hope. (Because, really, her witty comebacks are the best. More people need to hear them). I’m excited to get to know Gabi even more and hopefully have a board night together next mod!

>To Brian Goss: Since the start of Module 1, Goss has been a supportive and knowledgeable classmate to go to in times of struggle or just to hold a normal conversation with. He also took the initiative in creating lessons on important topics and shared his findings with the entire cohort multiple times. His teaching style is one that comes from true compassion and displays a vast amount of patience, which makes him very approachable in times of need. I’m excited to have him as a cohort mate once more in Module 2.

>To Jean Joeris: Getting to know Jean this module has been extremely delightful and I feel as though you can come to him with just about any query and he’ll receive without hesitation. He is also very good at following-up with people if he knew they were struggling before. I’m excited to see the kinds of projects he comes up with in the near future as I’m sure they’re going to be pretty incredible. Any team, either during Turing or in post-grad life, would be lucky to have such an intersectionality-minded asset!

>To Susi Irwin: Having Susi as my partner on Night Writer was a gift within itself. She is extremely easy going, intelligent and kind. Even though she has important priorities at home, we both were able to effectively collaborate during times we were apart and paired well when together. Her communication skills are on point; there never was a time that I did not know what she was working on or how she was feeling. She should know that she is more technically inclined than she gives herself credit for and that she is very good at knowing when she needs to ask for help. Because of that, she was a significant reason as to why we were successful with Night Writer in general.

>To Jesse Spevek: Dream Team status! Working with Jesse on Black Thursday was an excellent learning opportunity in more ways than one. Not only is he a Google/Excel spreadsheet whiz, he’s also a stickler with TDD which are two things that I wish I were better at. Jesse led the charge in terms of highly-organized file structures and gorgeous tests. While working with him, I learned that he has high standards for himself, but he shouldn’t let those translate into unwarranted anxiety and pressure as often in the future. He’s extremely intelligent and talented with the crushing of the code, so he shouldn’t worry as much. I have no idea how he juggled all of the hours he spent on this project while also keeping up with his baby twins and wife, but we paired effectively together and I thoroughly enjoyed working with him.

### Being a Community Member

>From Gabi Procell: "I am always astounded at Jasmin's organizational skills as well as how much cool information that she provides to the Turing community. I'm not quite sure where she finds time for it all, but she seems to fit in so much community time in addition to her work time -- and that completely amazes me. I also appreciate how she stepped up to be a representative for our cohort in the SAB. You're an amazing organization queen!"

>From Jean Joeris: "Jasmin is a wonderful person as well as an asset to our cohort. She has a welcoming and friendly attitude that is a joy to be around. Her project management experiece is extremely valuable. She has taught lots of us how to use productivity tools like Trello, Waffle, etc. I look forward to working on projects with her, given her organizational strengths. On a personal note, I have enjoyed our conversations about feminism."

### Playing a Part

* Actively participated in Student Advisory Board and tried to stress the importance of SAB to my cohort so that they could effectively make use of the resource early on.

* Attempted to help my cohort tackle effective project management by showing them Trello and task management methodologies.

* Actively participated within Joan Clarke Society and outside-Turing events focused toward Women and POC in Tech.

* Tried to re-arrange the Big Workspace at the end of every Friday so it was back to normal and ready to go for Monday (or the folks camping out over the weekend).

* Already planning a Friday Spike session on how to make your Twitter ~*~shine~*~ in the TwitterTechverse for Module 2 (in collaboration with Madison Kerndt from 1606-FE).
