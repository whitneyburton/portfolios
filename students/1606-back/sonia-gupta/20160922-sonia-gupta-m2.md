# Sonia Gupta - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Last module involved some personal issues that required me to repeat Mod 2. My experience at Turing has involved a lot of falling down, crumbling, and then getting back up again. This round was no different. I set out to cement the knowledge I had gleaned last time and I believe I have accomplished that. Even more important, however, is that I set out to build my own resilience and to develop the internal fortitude necessary to soldier on in the face of frequent setbacks. I have been a quitter before, but I vowed that I would not let myself down this time. I can confidently say that I kept that vow, and I intend never to break it again.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We worked on a number of tutorials this module which gradually tested and increased our knowledge of web applications. We began with Sinatra and finally graduated to Rails. Both frameworks helped to cement our understanding of CRUD functionality.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/robot_world2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

Robot World involved creating a Sinatra app from scratch. It involved full CRUD functionality as well as some model functionality.

---

### Blogger

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

I completed Blogger the first time I did Module 2, but did not complete it this time around. The project introduced us to Rails and reinforced the MVC concepts while providing practice on database migrations and workflow.

---

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/mix_master2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master taught us how to deploy an app to Heroku and how to model different kinds of data relationships. We also learned how to create partials and how to fabricate objects for testing.

---

### Rails Mini Project - IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

The Rails Mini Project brought all of the Rails concepts together. We created more complex relationships, performed migrations, and implemented CRUD functionality.

---

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two team projects this module, one which focused on data associations and relationships in Sinatra (Rush Hour) and another which focused on building a web-app with full CRUD functionality in Rails (Little Shop).

### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/rush-hour-skeleton)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour mimicked a traffic analysis tool and taught us about the HTTP request-response cycle while developing our understanding of complex data associations.

From Jasmin Hudacsek: Sonia was an absolute pleasure to work with on Rush Hour. Even though she had worked on the project before, she didn’t let her prior experience steal her other teammates’ learning experience at all. She was very communicative and clearly expressed when she was happy or concerned about our progress. While she sometimes doubts her own skills and internalizes these sentiments to her depriment, her working through this while working on Rush Hour also helped me realize that I am sometimes blind to my communication style and how it could also be improved. I would be lucky to have her as a partner again moving on to Module 3 and 4. Plus, she still keeps those fridges sparkling clean, and EVERYONE continues to benefit from her rockstar-ness.

### Little Shop of Orders - The Waddams Emporium

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop taught us how to build out a web application with full CRUD functionality and complex data associations, user authentication, and authorization. We also developed our styling skills and pushed the application up to Heroku.

From Susi Irwin: Sonia's passion and commitment to our project, to learning, and to her classmates is incredible. Her collaboration skills are inspiring and working with her in both a group and a pair setting has been such a great experience. She has no fear with just getting her hands into the code and trying something out. Sonia taught me that sometimes the best way to think through a complicated problem is just write some code and see what happens! She is an code-experimenter and it is awesome! If I could offer Sonia one point to work on it would be to work on articulating herself when her frustration starts to kick in. There was one moment during Little Shop where a hidden application file would not show up on her computer and she was getting a bit stressed out about it. I would urge her to not be so hard on herself when things get a little off track. Sonia is so talented and I am just thrilled that I finally got to work alongside her!

## D: Professional Skills

This module's focus on professional skills was very useful. It helped me to refocus my drive and the purpose of my time at Turing.

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

I really appreciated this Gear Up's emphasis on the journey involved in getting better at something. It can be easy to lose sight of that when I'm fixated on the end result. There is no end result without all of the work in between. For me this has consisted in doing the smallest possible thing and then doing the next smallest thing. Much like coding!

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

I was absent on the date of this Gear Up due to illness.

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

This Gear Up seemed to stir up strong emotions in the Turing Community. I realized that there are a lot of people who become incredibly defensive when confronted with their inability to face their own prejudices. The film and the ensuing fallout reinvigorated my drive to better understand what motivates humans to respect and care about each other in mutually beneficial ways.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fs65d1N8eT2yoPHQE74NUM-UdLs1PxMSfovryHL6xJM/edit?usp=sharing)

I learned the importance of simply reaching out, not with the goal of gaining employment, but with the goal of learning about people in this industry and how they do what they do.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
  * In both projects we used Waffle extensively and it was a fantastic tool for keeping us on track. Unfortunately, there were times when ideas were vaguely discussed but no cards were made for them, and those ideas would either not be completed or someone would simply take it upon themselves to implement functionality without discussing it with the rest of the group or giving others the opportunity to contribute.


2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
  * I learned to simply voice my opinions and have more faith in my ability to contribute to projects. I was less afraid to dive in and offer suggestions than I have been in the past, and this is due to receiving feedback about having more confidence in my abilities.

#### Networking with Lia

I learned the importance of branding myself properly. I find the prospect of selling myself to be very intimidating, but Lia framed the process in an engaging way that allowed me to feel more confident about it.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jasmin Hudacsek: Jasmin was such a pleasure to work with. Rush Hour moved like clockwork due to her excellent project management skills. Our group was cohesive and collaborative, and she really helped keep us on track. She has a depth of knowledge and understanding that is truly impressive, and I learned a lot from her. On a personal level, Jasmin has proven herself to be kind, empathetic, and mature beyond her years. She has considerable emotional intelligence and approaches problems calmly and with reassurance for all involved. I hope I get the opportunity to work with her again, and I’m really glad to know her.

To Susi Irwin: Susi was such an incredibly supportive team mate. Her optimism and drive made it an absolute blast to work with her. She was willing to push through the difficult parts of the project while maintaining composure. I was most impressed with Susi’s supportive attitude when pairing. I have often been second-guessed and limited by partners who don’t trust that I am capable of coding. Susi never made me feel that way. She was open and willing to try things with me, and was patient even when I failed. I also learned a good bit of CSS from her and look forward to learning more! One thing Susi might work on is decompressing a bit when tricky bugs pop up. We had a moment on the last day of the project where our logout functionality was not working. Susi seemed to be quite distressed, but she pushed through and helped us to find a solution. I would encourage Susi to remember that she is absolutely capable of moving through these difficulties the next time a bug pops up so that she can retain her optimism even during the rough patches. I think we could both probably stand to remember that about ourselves!

### Being a Community Member

From Jasmin Hudacsek: Sonia was an absolute pleasure to work with on Rush Hour. Even though she had worked on the project before, she didn’t let her prior experience steal her other teammates’ learning experience at all. She was very communicative and clearly expressed when she was happy or concerned about our progress. While she sometimes doubts her own skills and internalizes these sentiments to her depriment, her working through this while working on Rush Hour also helped me realize that I am sometimes blind to my communication style and how it could also be improved. I would be lucky to have her as a partner again moving on to Module 3 and 4. Plus, she still keeps those fridges sparkling clean, and EVERYONE continues to benefit from her rockstar-ness.

From Susi Irwin: Sonia's passion and commitment to our project, to learning, and to her classmates is incredible.

### Playing a Part

I definitely think I could have participated more in the community this module, but I really needed to focus on developing confidence in my skills because everything has taken me so much longer to absorb than it has for most of my peers. I did pair with Module 1 students on a few occasions and also continued with the fridge purge on Fridays.
