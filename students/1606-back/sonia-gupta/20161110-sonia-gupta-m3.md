### A: End of Module Assessment

Student: Sonia

Notes:

* Overall really solid.
* One challenge to solve: How can you prevent making two API calls to gather the count and the store objects?
* Separation of concerns is great.
* Provided API is done well.
* Good use of serializers.
* Tests are solid. Some room to make them a bit more specific (ie testing against more attributes on the Store class) but overall really solid.

## To Sonia

### From Jasmin:
After working with Sonia in a group setting once before during Rush Hour in Mod 2, I was in an excellent position to see how much she has worked on previous feedback she has received since then. As our project manager for our group, I know she felt nervous about taking on that organizational responsibility, but she successfully kept us on track with the important tasks at hand and really drove us to get the more complicated tasks done first. One thing I wish she would do less is automatically take the bulk of responsibility when something doesn't go as planned. Everything is a group effort, and we're all responsible for the good and bad parts--but even with that in mind, the things that didn't go exactly right were really complicated and we wouldn't have had any upload or downloading as quickly as we did without her drive and excitement to research the AWS sdk gem.

### From Bryan:
You did an amazing job getting Amazon S3 working. I think you underestimate yourself, and you often believe people are judging you more harshly than they actually are. Its great that you have such high standards that I felt like I had to work to live up to them.

## From Sonia

### To Bryan:
Bryan, it was such a pleasure working with you. I think we really became good friends on this project, and I'm so glad to know you. I don't think any of my feedback will be much of a surprise to you because I feel we communicated pretty well throughout the project. You did a great job when we were pairing because you allowed me to drive more (we had talked about this) but I think perhaps you could have allowed me to speak more, particularly when I wanted to be involved in our discussions with instructors, in order to foster a shared feeling of engagement in the problem-solving process. Overall, however, I really appreciated having the chance to work with you. I consider you to be a true friend and I've learned a lot from you. You're bright, funny, and kind. Keep on keeping on. :)

### To Jasmin:
Jasmin! I always love working with you. We always have fun and there is such an abundance of laughter. You really did a great job with the CRUD functionality on this project. I noticed at some moments during our pairing that we both suffer from the same problem of sometimes not formulating our thoughts succinctly before verbalizing them. I noticed this sometimes when we were working together, more so when we had been pairing for a long stretch like the day we worked on the uploads controller. I also need to work on this, so I'm not faulting you for this at all. It's probably more noticeable when we're both doing it, because we end up talking over each other a bit. There were other moments, however, like the night when we were dealing with Authy and Lauren came over for the check-in, and you were quiet for a while and then suddenly sprang to life with exactly the right answer (twice). That was amazing! It's hard to be actionable on this (I'm currently struggling with this myself and have a long way to go) but sometimes being more present in the meditative / mindfulness sense helps to slow down my thoughts. Ultimately you are such a blast to work with. You are all of the things that the tech community needs. Bright, thoughtful, considerate, conscientious, mature, hardworking, kind, and fun. Thanks for a great experience.

### To Matt:
Hey Matt. I really appreciated your effort on the action mailer part of this and also on the styling. As a group we already addressed some of our mutual concerns, so I don't necessarily feel the need to go into that stuff here. I really liked how you absorbed some of our feedback and chose to become a more active participant in the project. You did a good job on the portions of the project that you chose to work on, but you could have communicated with us more about your progress and decisions because that would have introduced a good opportunity for you to pair with us more or become more involved. I think you're a really kind person and a good coder and I'm glad I got to work with you. :)
###### Area of growth
In terms of an area of growth, I would like to see Sonia apologize less - out of all the times I heard her apologize when working with her, I don't think I can think of a single instance that she did anything wrong or worth apologizing over. Part of that might come from not having confidence in her technical skill set, which is considerable.

From David Davydov: I once told Sonia that she was a cyborg, and I still think this may partly be true. What impressed me about Sonia more than anything was her ability to hold massive amounts of information in her head, make sense of it all, and when she didn't know something she would know the right place to reference it. She is an organizational master. Often during our project, I would know that we'd need to use a technique we learned in a random lesson some odd days ago. Whenever I would ask her where I could reference this technique, she wouldn't hesitate before responding with the right answer. My pairing experience with Sonia was always positive. There was a moment during the project that the approach we were taking was getting complicated and I suggested that we slow down and try another way. My delivery is something I could work on, and when what I said came off as off-putting, Sonia let me know and I appreciated it. I reminded Sonia that I always recognized her super-human commitment and dedication to the team. I would be excited to work with and learn more from Sonia in the future, she is a strong resource to any group she works with.

## D: Professional Skills

This module's focus on professional skills was very useful. It helped me to refocus my drive and the purpose of my time at Turing.

### Gear Up
#### Voting

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

I appreciated the opportunity to discuss with my peers the importance of voting and what it means to be a citizen.

#### Introversion

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This Gear Up exposed all of us, as community members, to the different styles of thinking and communicating that exist between extroverts and introverts. It was useful to hear the experiences of both types of people.

#### Resilience

I was excused from attending this Gear Up in order to meet with a public speaking coach who helped me prepare for a Meetup talk.

#### Alumni Portfolio

I entered all of my information into the website but it does not appear to be uploading.

#### Personal Project Pitch

Project Title: FitIn

### Pitch
This app will help a user track her physical activity level as it correlates with her daily calendar activity.

### Problem
If you have problems sticking to a fitness regimen, being able to chart the physical activity you do engage in is important to maintaining motivation and habitual behavior. Knowing how your fitness activities correlate with your daily life activities can help to show trends in your behavior. This knowledge can help you to better tailor your calendar schedule and your fitness schedule so as to maximize the utility you derive from both.

### Solution
FitIn will collect your user data from your Fitbit account and will access your Google calendar from your Google calendar account. FitIn will find your most physically active days and your least physically active days using a predetermined metric (possibly exercise activity completion rates, or most consecutive hours with physical activity -- both of these are Fitbit metrics). It will then find those days on your Google Calendar and provide you with a list of the most common activity type name (i.e. meeting, drinks) occurring on those days.

### Target Audience
FitIn will be useful to many people. Future functionality will include suggesting the best workout times and types for an individual depending on her daily schedule. The most likely type of user would be a busy young professional who is beginning to get into exercising more frequently but who is finding it difficult to maintain motivation.

### Integrations
* FitIn will use the Fitbit API and the Googsle Calendar API.
* Omniauth has gems for both Fitbit and Google, but it seems useful, in terms of learning, to implement Oauth using Twilio and Authy for user sign-in.


#### Flower Exercise

#### Job Search Strategy

I intend to have at least one meeting with a contact during the intermission. I will update my resume and LinkedIn over the break. Next module I will be sending out my resume and making contact with people and sending out intro emails to have coffee at least once a week. I also intend to go to at least 4 meetups next module.
