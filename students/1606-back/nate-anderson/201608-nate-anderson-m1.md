### Areas of Emphasis

As a repeater, I set out to solidify my knowledge in all areas of programming. I knew that my weak areas involved encapsulation and passing information between classes in the most efficient manner.  I worked hard in these areas and now feel comfortable performing these actions. I feel repeating has given me a deeper understanding of ruby in general. I am thankful I was able to have this time to build my confidence and now I feel very ready to take on module 2.

### End of Module Assessment

### Work

I completed the following projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Description: This project creates a linked list and we can add, prepend, find, and insert fragments of words to the list, which comprise our 'beats.' We then use the jungle_beat class to play these beats through the terminal on the computer.

Evaluation Comments: Completed 2 extensions
Built with TDD, thorough suite of tests
Opp to improve with test names
Nice extraction of methods in some cases, would like to see that process applied consistently across code
Some refactoring needed, minor opportunities to make code more readable
Watch using data structure labels in variable names
Nice use of loops, would like to see experimentation with recursion

Evaluation Scores: 
1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

Description: Build a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player. This game will be able to display a realistic board that will represent misses and hits of both
the computer and user during the other's respective turns.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Ben Pepper: "Ben has been extremely helpful to me both academically and non-academically through my repeating mod1.  Academically, he was an amazing partner for Enigma and has a really great mind for organization and how to go about attacking a program.  He was definitely the driving force of the project and always had an answer for something when I had little idea of what to do next. Non academically, he is very encouraging and always willing to help me or anyone else with a problem they may be having. Overall, a great asset to Turing and our cohort."

To Jean Joeris: "Jean is an amazing programmer and an even better person. His intuition and dedication to efficiency wowed me on a daily basis during our project. He strives to make the best choices possible and does not rest until he does so. Even with his great knowledge, he is egoless and always takes the time to make sure everything is understood. If anyone has a problem, Jean is the first to help. I could not have asked for a better partner and am thankful we were able to get to know each other better during this time."

To Raphael Barbo: "I have gotten to know Raphael over the past few months as a fellow repeater and he is always a great presence to have around. Besides his blossoming into a great programmer he always has a smile on his face and a kind word for anyone around him. When we have paired together he has always been encouraging and I am glad to have him in my cohort. A great asset to Turing and the community in general."

### Being a Community Member

From Ben Pepper: "Nate was a fantastic partner.  He was a grounding force that helped me focus and stay on track while working on Enigma.  He was able to figure out how “crack” worked before I had even had a chance to wrap my head around the idea.  He is very methodical in his approach and I would not have made it out of Enigma without Nate."

From Jean Joeris: "Nate is a great partner. He understands how he learns best and communicates that clearly. He is very self-aware, and advocates for himself in effective ways. He isn’t afraid to question someone's logic, or ask for time to digest and think about the code.  He could improve his refactoring skills, but he is aware of that and actively works to improve them. Nate is a kind and caring person that has been a joy to work with. He is encouraging to partners and I'm glad I got to work with him.""

From Raphael Barbo: "Nate’s progress this module is beyond measure. He is one of the most dedicated, hard-working people I have ever known. Nate has an amazing personality, always with a big smile on his face, and one of the humblest attitude in the game, I am super happy to have shared another module with him, and can’t wait what this awesome human being accomplishes during the upcoming modules."

### Playing a Part

The best thing about Turing to me is the community which is always ready at a moment's notice to drop
everything and help you with what you are struggling with. I try to take this to heart on an everyday basis
and if anyone is struggling I try to take the time to share whatever limited expertise I may hold.

### Readme

#### Black Thursday 

The goal of the project was to build a sales engine to that could read in and store data for a hypothetical online store. With this base engine, data analysis was performed with an eye towards business logic. The original spec is here

Installation

Get the URL for cloning
Move to the directory you want it to be located and do git clone <cloning url>
Install the gems with bundle install
You're ready to go!
Usage

Currently the program is not used much other than against tests. The easiest way to use it would be to open it in IRB/pry

Open your favorite Ruby REPL
require './lib/sales_engine'
Create a new sales engine instance
Load CSVs into sales engine using #from_csv
(if analytics are desired) require './lib/sales_analyst'
Create a new instance of sales analyst, initialized with the sales engine
Contributing

Fork it!
Create your feature branch: git checkout -b my-new-feature
Commit your changes: git commit -am 'Add some feature'
