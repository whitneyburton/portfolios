### Areas of Emphasis

Academically, my primary goal when commencing matriculation at Turing was to come in *tabula rasa*, leaving all past experience, expectation, and ego behind, and to completely go "all in" for the Turing method. My hope was that with this approach I would be best prepared to absorb any and all material that would be thrown at us. I also set a goal for myself to not lose sight of the fact that I'm here because I love learning and coding, as well as to maintain an eager curiosity throughout my time here. I am proud to report that I stuck to these goals and it has paid off in spades. In retrospect it's difficult to believe the immense amount of knowledge I have absorbed in just six weeks, and the fact that I've been thoroughly enjoying it as well.

Non-academically, a second goal I set for myself was with regard to self-care. Specifically, my goal was to eat well and sleep enough every day. I'm also glad to report that I have succeeded in both of these endeavors through the duration of the module.

### Projects

Projects at Turing are generally assigned on a weekly basis. They can take dozens of hours and are meticulously crafted to such that the concepts being learned at the time will be required to complete them.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/calaway/flash_cards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

We created a terminal based flashcard study tool in which a user could load in their digital questions and answers in a text file and then utilize this app to quiz themselves. This challenge required an understanding of object oriented programming and design as well as test driven development to succeed.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Looking at flashcards
* 24 tests that all pass
* Tests are easy to understand, test many contrapositives
* Implementation is clean and straightforward

##### Evaluation Rubric

###### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

###### 5. Enumerable & Collections

### Projects

In Night Writer we created an app that will read plaintext English from a text file supplied by the user, translate it to braille, and output the result to another text file. It will additionally do the reverse to translate a braille text file back to plaintext English. This project emphasized creative algorithmic thinking and problem solving.

### Giving Feedback

To __Angela Lindow:__<br />
Angela has been an awesome asset to our Mod 1 cohort. As the leader of both Hopper Posse, of which I am a member, and my study group, Angela has been enormously helpful to me during the last six weeks in the intense journey through learning the fundamentals of coding. She is incredibly knowledgable, intelligent, caring, patient, and selfless in sharing her time, a combination which makes her a fantastic resource for all of us who have had the fortune of working with her. The Turing community is truly lucky to have her.

To __Kris Sparks:__<br />
Kris has been an incredible help to our Mod 1 cohort over the past six weeks. His knowledge of the subjects and intelligence shows through immediately when you work with him. He openly admits that he may not pick up all the complex concepts as quickly as the top students at turing, and I think that is part of what makes him a fantastic teacher. He puts in long hours gaining a mastery of the material, then he has a good memory for which portions were the most difficult. I think this struggle gives him a unique ability to assist students through the intense deluge of information and concepts that is life at Turing. 

He is very empathetic and has a knack for knowing when other students are struggling. I've seen him seemingly sense when someone has been stuck on a problem, but might not have built up the courage to ask someone, and approach that student preemptively to offer assistance. He is also selfless with his time and I've often seen him check through each classroom before he leaves for the day, already late in the evening, to ask anybody still working if they're doing okay or if they have any questions he can help with. Kris truly an asset to the students of the Turing community.

To __Caleb Cowen:__<br />
Caleb has been an incredible asset for our Mod 1 cohort. He consistently went above and beyond the call of duty in dedicating many hours to pairing with us. When working with Caleb his knowledge of the subject, intelligence, and passion for coding are immediately apparent. He has a talent for breaking down complex concepts into an easily digestible format, and his grasp of design principles were enormously helpful on the projects he assisted me with.

Outside of academics Caleb has been awesome at bringing the community together to decompress over social activities. He was warm and inclusive to our new Mod 1 cohort starting on our very first week. In this highly intensive environment, the impact of small gestures such as these that Caleb excels at truly cannot be overstated. He is a great asset to the Turing community.

To __Kinan Whyte:__<br />
Kinan has been a pleasure to work with on our Black Friday project. His excellent communication has been one of our primary advantages and was apparent from our initial DTR. He welcomes all feedback while providing constructive and insightful feedback of his own. He has the ability to remain focused, productive, and enjoyable to work with even at the end of long work days and under times of high stress. He is very much on top of the material we have covered and is quick to point us in the right direction. In times when we didn't know what direction we needed to take he would ask well crafted questions that would point us down the path to the solution. His intelligence, eager acceptance of new ideas, keen ability to look at problems in a unique way, passion for coding, and general good nature make him a great asset to any team.

To __Michael Hill:__<br />
Michael was a pleasure to work with on our Nightwriter project. He is an excellent communicator, which was immediately apparent in our original DTR session. He was very forthcoming when speaking to his current proficiencies, areas that he hoped to improve, and communication/feedback styles and preferences, which later helped us successfully navigate through a very challenging project. Even in the times when he did not yet have a complete comprehension of the material, he contributed greatly by asking many questions that would often lead us down a path to the correct solution, or allow us to expound on the concepts, ultimately leading to a better understanding on all sides. He was very flexible on work times. He took all feedback well and was lavish with compliments and praise. I hope to get the chance to work with him again in the future.

To __Dan Boradbent:__<br />
Dan was a pleasure to work with on our Nightwriter project. His communication was excellent from the very first DTR through the end. He gave well thought out and constructive feedback and was very open to receiving any back. He was quick to make good suggestions, apply new concepts learned in class, and ask excellent questions that pushed us toward a successful finished product. I would consider myself lucky to be paired with Dan again on any future project.

### Being a Community Member

From __Angela Lindow:__<br />
From the first time I paired with Calaway, I was impressed by his natural talent for logical, algorithmic thinking. He doesn't shy away from difficult questions and is able to find the fun in working towards the solution. His calm, even-keel temperament makes him a pleasure to work with. He is always striving to find not just a solution, but the best solution.

From __Kinan Whyte:__<br />
Calaway has offered great value to our biggest project this module in many ways. From a mathematical background, he offers a very strong way of looking at problems by holding an immense amount of complexity all at once, yet is able to hold a simple and concise approach to each step. This is an immensely valuable asset. Working with Calaway has been very smooth. He offers a skilled way of articulating abstract concepts in programming and is willing to look at problems through any new or fresh lenses that may be offered to the table. His collaborative skills are on point. He's able to push through difficult problems quickly, but the speed is not overwhelming or overdriven. Rather, the patience, poise, interpersonal communication, and awareness of workflow efficiency, make Calaway stand out so well in a team.

From __Michael Hill:__<br />
Calaway was a great partner on the Nightwriter project.  His attitude and approach to tackling difficult concepts was eye opening.  The more difficult the concept the more he seemed to enjoy it and push through to find the solution. His enthusiasm was encouraging and helped keep us on track through every step of project. His work ethic as well as his team first attitude make him ideal to pair with.  Hopefully we will get the chance to work together again in the future.

From __Dan Broadbent:__<br />
Calaway was a pleasure to work with on the Nightwriter project.  He was enthusiastic about the work we were doing and went above and beyond to make sure that we met all the base requirements on time.  We all had a great experience with this project because we did a thorough job defining the relationship, and everyone followed through with what was expected of them.

From __Chase Dunagan:__<br />
Calaway is an amazing piece of the Mod-1 puzzle.  He is kind to everyone and his calm demeanor is contagious when interacting and pairing with him, which makes it easier to assess the problem at hand.  Whenever I go to Calaway with a question, he doesn’t hesitate to drop what he is doing, and mull over my problem with me.  He is exactly the type of intelligent, kind, and inclusive student that Turing hopes to attract.  And I look forward to working with him throughout my time at Turing.

### Playing a Part

During Module 1 I have attended all Turing functions, such as guest speakers, lightning talks, meet & greets, alumni homecoming, et cetera. I have also made it a point to go the extra mile to try to raise morale among my peers with lavish enthusiasm, positive feedback, and high-fives during stressful study times.

I am excited to report that I have coordinated with Matthew Campbell and have volunteered to take over organizing the Mod 2 >> Mod 1 pairing schedule. I truly appreciate the assistance they have offered us and I have been eagerly anticipating the day that I will be in a position to help out the next generation of Turing students. I believe my love of learning and teaching, my talent for organizing community functions, and my ability to communicate things in a clear and consice mannor will make me well suited to take over this position.
