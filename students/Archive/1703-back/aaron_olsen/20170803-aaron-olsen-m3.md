# Aaron Olsen - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Module three was one part building on previous knowledge and two parts navigating uncharted territories. My goal for module three was to answer the question "if I don't know it, how can I learn it?"

1. Building on Previous Knowledge
  * Mod 2 gave me a good foundation for building a basic Rails App. Crudding out functionality, authorization and authentication, moving logic down the stack, etc... Mod 3 added mid level complexity to the Rails app with Internal and External APIs, OAuth, Multitenancy, Security, Advanced SQL, Caching, Stack Organization, Javascript/JQuery, and App Optimization.
2. How to Learn the Thing?
  * Process is one of the hardest things to get right in coding. It's easy to fall into bad habits, fail to take good advice, _not_ learn from your mistakes, or ignore red flags. While this wasn't directly taught during mod 3, it became a necessary focus as the tasks given to us became more complex. Doing the thing can always be done, but can you do it in a timely manner with a good process? It turns out that learning a computer language is the easy part. The hard part is breaking down the problems, focusing energies in the right places, and understanding where, as an individual coder, you need to customize good process to serve you best. Mod 3 taught me that I'm not going to get this right away. But when I do follow good process, I am far more successful.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[Twelve Volt](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/twelve_volt)**
>* Twelve Volt is a retake of my previous Physics Engine [Nine Volt](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/nine-volt-motor). The goal of this project is to make a fully functioning, but basic, 2d physics engine written in pure Ruby. It's fully testing written to high Ruby standards. The end result should be a great educational product that's also fun!
>* One might ask why I have taken this on. My answer, 'because it's hard'. It has not been easy or always fun, but it has kept me sharp and helped me towards my goal of mastering Ruby. Process is paramount in a project like this as the complexity very quickly becomes unwieldy.

> **[Mr A Blog](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/mr_a_blog)**
>* Mr A Blog is my personal blog site. Aside from soon giving me a place to exercise the art of explaining things, it has given me a place to implement lessons I have learned at Turing. It has also taught me the hard balancing act one must try to achieve when taking on multiple projects.

## B: Group Work & Projects

### Rales Engine
>**[GitHub](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/rails_engine)** | **[Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* Rales Engine is an exclusive API app designed to highlight API JSON rendering and serializing, API endpoint design, complex API business logic with advanced sql and ActiveRecord, and stack organization of API routing. Full testing of API requests used tools such as VCR, Webmock, and advanced RSpec tricks to accurately test API rending.
>* This is under _Group Projects_, but I ended up doing this project on my own. I managed to meet the expectations of the paired groups but sacrificed some testing in order to tackle more complex problems. This project demonstrated that following good process can lead to productive and well written code.

### Trail Up (Cloney Island Green Field)
>**[GitHub](https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/trail-up)** | **[Spec](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
>* Trail Up is a greenfield project based on the idea of Meetup.com. Find hikes in your area, make an event, signup for events, and hike!
>* My involvement in this project were mainly around setting up the Google map for displaying the location of trails, locating new trails, and editing trails. This was mainly done in Javascript making AJAX calls to endpoints that then made API calls to the TrailProject API. My second main contribution was setting up an Amazon AWS service to hold images uploaded through Carrierwave.


### Fairbnb (Cloney Island Brown Field)
>**[GitHub](https://github.com/iamchrissmith/air_bnb_clone)**
>* Fairbnb is a brownfield project first started by the 1610 backend crew. It's a clone of Airbnb with only some minor tweeks.
>* Taking on a brownfield project like this was far more valuable than it was annoying. The lesson is a hard one - we all write some bad code and then someone else has to deal with it. Empathy for those that produced that code is hard to muster, but the truth is that someone's struggling to do the same with yours. My contribution to this project centered around searching for properties. Searching is done via AJAX calls to endpoints chaining search queries to filter results.

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
> Student notes: Because I was doing this project solo, tests were not written for basic index and show endpoints in favor of higher level sql business logic and refactoring. I think it's worth noting that aside from TDD I managed to complete the same work as a paired team.

## C. **Gear Ups**

>[Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

>Microaggressions are often offhand, sometimes not intended to be nagitive, or completely by accident. Sometimes they arn't. Regardless, they have impact. This is a situation when you need to start by assuming best intentions. Reacting to microagressions is a subtle art. You need to make sure the aggressor knows they are doing something, but not without turning into the agressor in the process. You need to know when to fix the moment and when to fix the bigger problem. Dealing with the situation could be as simple as deflecting the comment, asking for elaboration, or using sarcasm. Dealing with the problem might mean a private discussion or forming a plan, like woman in the Whitehouse.

>[Allyship](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

>Allyship is a process of building relationships with marginalized communities. These relationships are based on trust, consistency, and accountability.

>[Coding Schools or Coding Fools]()

>It can be easy to doubt the choice we've made to come to a coding school. It often feels crazy and overly risky. But the reality is that those fears are nested in long standing societal norms of what constitutes and education. Unfortunately both our grade level and higher education institutions are failing the tech industry by not putting increased focus on coding and technology. To fill that gap, code schools have materialized. At the end of the day, if schools produce good students and the industry accepts them, then it's a viable option. What the future of these school holds is still to be seen, but even by now it's hard to imagine them completely going away.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* Posses changed this mod to meeting with an assigned group rather than joining posses already formed. The transition was a little awkward having known the previous system, but the previous system had it's flaws. It's worth trying something new when what your doing isn't going well.
  >* The posse I was in mostly sat down tried to trouble shoot peoples current problem. Sometimes that was a project issue or understanding for assessment. When not doing that we shared our experiences for the week and just got to know one another.
  >* This time around the posse was an exercise in adjusting to something new. The posse system is a work in progress and being a part of making it good requires doing your best to see where it fails and where it succeeds.

#### **Playing a Part**

> I made an effort this mod to assist and pair with some Mod 1 backend students. I'll admit, though, that I didn't do as much as I would have hoped. This probably hurt me more than not. There seems to be a direct correlation between selfishness and overall performance. The more you focus on yourself, the harder it becomes to see where you're failing. Getting outside of that; assisting others, and contributing to the greater good, is one of the best ways to counter that downward spiral.
