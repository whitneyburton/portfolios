# \<Mason Holland> - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \<What did you set out to accomplish this module?>
- This module I set out to gain an understanding of API's and to get a solid foundation to move into mod 4.
- I also was made SAB rep and so ensuring I was a good advcate for my class mates was very important.
- Group projects were also a big focus, as I wanted to be the best group mate possible.

## Self-Assessment

| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 4 |

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
I have many takeaways from this module. It was my most challenging alongside mod 1. I came to an understanding that I need to 'study' more. I need to be going home at the end of each day and synthesizing what I gleaned from that days lessons. I had a wonderful time in Mod 3 but I wish I could have gotten better grades and done better on the end of module assessment. Have yet to end a module feeling differently on that front however.

>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://)**
>* \<Description>
Create an API that serves up data relating to transactions, items and merchants. Construct business intelligence endpoints to serve up various abstractions of the data set. Use SQL or ActiveRecord to retrieve information.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a fun project, at first the challenge of making an API was daunting. But after much practice and repition it became an enjoyable grind. The business logic/intelligence was also a unique challenge. We have created many queries before but these were especially unique as they provided a new level of complexity. I needed help on a few of the tougher ones, but found the project to be an enjoyable learning experience.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island#sprint-1---individual-evaluation)**
>* \<Description>
Clone a web app or create an approved unique idea. Create an internal API to serve up all info needed from database. Consume an external API. Complete a personal user story.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
This was a tough project. I had some good work and learning on the project, however due to external circumstances I found myself having to work on basic features isntead of my personal story. I think in future I will be more vocal with groupmates that I am having difficulties with. Enjoyed the process though and loved the opportunity to work with Chris Smith.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island#-sprint-2---final-evaluation-rubric)**
>* \<Description>
Continue building on the code base created by a different group. Ideally meet the sprint 1 requirements if those were not met by the original group. Add additional features and create a superior product.

>* \<Takeaways, your experience>
Enjoyed this sprint a great deal more. The foreign codebase was an enjoyable struggle, it provided new challenges and learning. Found the process of building assets around already working pieces to be a valuable experience. Enjoyed working with my team and brainstorming how we could build upon the product.

## B. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
\<This was a valuable session. I found myself reading the list of microaggressions and realizing I was resonsible for saying many of them. I felt some were very context dependent, I like to joke and I know I had used some of the lines in jest and hope I have not offended any parties. I am regularly thinking of that list and how I can avoid offending anyone.>

> [Link To Gear Up](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)
\<This was alos a valuable session, I enjoyed the discussion with my peers and hearing all the different approaches and thought processes. I found that there were many things I could be doing to encourage openness and honesty amongst my peers and classmates. I tried to implement one of Ilana's solutions however and didn't find much success(not many people wanted to go bowling). I now strive to be an ally to any of those who might need it.>

> Student Led Gear Up; Learning a Language.
\<Really enjoyed this session, always a pleasure to see other students take the reigns and lead gear ups. I found this session particularly relevant as I near the end of my time at Turing and start to pick up new languages and tools. Knowing how and when to navigate that space is extremely daunting and challenging. Hearing everyones own personal experiences on the topic was valuable and has helped shape how I will approach new languages in the future.>

## C: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Pair 3 times>
Was not aware this was a requirement and was doing it out of my own desire. I paired many times this mod and enjoyed getting work with the new Mod 1's. I enjoy pairing and being able to see and help someone to a new, deeper understanding.  

#### **Posse**
  >* \<Blurb about what you did with your posse over the module>
  We did very little, dissapointed I didn't make more of the time.

  >* \<Your favorite thing about the posse experience>
  Natalia is there.

  >* \<How has your posse experience helped you grow as a professional?>
  It has taught me that some bureaucratic decisions will be made without your input and you may hate the outcome but must make the best of it.

#### **Playing a Part**

> \<How else you've contributed to the community>
SAB rep.
All round joker.
Encouraging those around me and ensuring I can help others in any way possible.
