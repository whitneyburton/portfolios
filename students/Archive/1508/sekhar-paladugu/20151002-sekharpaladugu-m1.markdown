### Your Mission

I wrote in my gear up the second week here that my mission here was to engage with my curiosity and enjoy programming and the total experience of building software. My goal here is to push myself to build a career-level foundation from which to learn over the coming years. The piece we read in that gear up titled "Invest in Your Intelligence" resonated with me and made me think through moments where I've felt discouraged or uncertain and how to tackle them, as well as what standard I should hold myself to at Turing. I've often been someone in the "smart but lazy" category, who will find or even create the path of least resistance and rely on my ability to learn quickly. My goal here is to push myself more, though Turing has also done a great job of not letting me be lazy :)

I've dedicated my nearly full focus to this program since August 24th, but I know I still have to work to do to fit in exercisms, mentor sessions, learning new technologies on the side and more, while also continually improve the quality of my work output. I also want to gradually begin networking and meeting folks in the field in companies
around town as I approach modules three and four. Overall though I've enjoyed my time here. I would love to find more moments where I feel like I'm in my flow state working through edge cases in Enigma or watching all of my team's tests pass on Headcount. Thanks again for everyone's help these past six weeks! Special shout out to Josh Cheek for always being around, available to help, and going way above and beyond what any teacher I've ever had would do for classmates and me. I'm looking forward to module two and can't wait to get my hands on rails.

### Attendance

I missed Friday, September 25th, for a wedding of a close family friend in Dallas, Texas. It was a pretty nuts event, especially the elephant procession down a street they shut down in central Dallas. I pre-approved this absence with Mike the first week and reminded him the week of about my absence.

### Work

I struggled through many of the projects this module. Projects as a whole don't come naturally to me, and I much prefer the focused exercises like exercisms, katas, assignments like mythical creatures and more. On the flip side, my comfort with self-directed projects has gone way up, and learning to learn on my own or find the resources I need. Still though, I enjoyed and did much better on the paired projects, though I'm not sure if that's a function of having a partner around to work with or the nature of that material.

#### Jungle Beat

Jungle Beat was a tough project for me personally. I had a bit of a crazy week closing out my last job (part-time tutoring ACT) so I had to backload much of the project work to the final 24-36 hours. I think if I had had one more day I would've been able to refactor it heavily to match the interaction model exactly. My big takeaway from the project was that Linked Lists are totally badass. When Shannon explained them and pointed out the endless curly brackets at the end in making them, that's when it clicked for me. I loved how this material dovetailed with the Ruby Object Model as well.

GitHub: http://github.com/sekharp/jungle_beats

Notes:

* some bits of interaction model do not work
* testing should check some more edge casing
* testing was made difficult because of FileIO
* 23 tests, all passing

Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Chisel

Chisel was a good first evaluated project/growing experience for me, though also a big struggle. I enjoyed the prospect of building a high level program that could parse, and that worked with real material like HTML and Markdown which are widely used. I also felt like I got the material mostly down, and the project was very functional, so I personally was surprised at the assessment that functionality was only part of the focus. After talking it over with my evaluator twice, I decided to just double down on my work studying the material, since the grade didn't ultimately matter to me. I also look at the project now at the end of the module and can tell exactly where I would spend time refactoring. This project was a strong learning experience around basic Ruby programming, such as writing multiple classes, File I/O, building methods and more.

Name: Sekhar Paladugu
Github: http://github.com/sekharp/chisel

Notes:
	* 40 runs, 37 assertions
	* number of very long methods
	* tests needed to be split by class
	* some objects with too much responsibility

Fundamental Ruby and Style: 2
Test Driven Development: 2
Functionality: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Sorting Suite

I switched to Foxtrot from Echo the day this project was due, so both Josh Cheek and Jeff Casimir told me that there was no need to evaluate me. I did not push this project to Github, but overall I finished Bubble Sort, did most of Insertion Sort, but never got around to Merge Sort. I felt the material was within my reach but even after studying it for a couple dozen hours it was above my head for week one. I would like to go back to this material over break and see if I could tackle it.

## Team

### Projects

I really enjoyed both of these projects. Enigma was a ton of fun, and I felt like the entire project just clicked for me. We finished by Thursday night of the week we got it, and had a minor amount of testing to finish up over the weekend. I also have read quite a bit about Alan Turing so was curious about it from that perspective.

Separately, I went through the rollercoaster of Headcount and came out a much better programmer at the end of it. Headcount was much, much larger than any of the other projects, so I was much more uncomfortable at first, but came out pretty satisfied and felt like I practiced many parts of the material stitched together. Every single project put me through a rollercoaster where I felt at first it seemed near impossible to finish on time and yet by the end the material felt manageable if not enjoyable.

#### Headcount

This project came out great! I'm so proud of our work. I carried us the first bit mostly and Penney really sealed the deal this week. I'm so impressed with how well it all came together in the final 48 hours. This project taught me quite a bit about teamwork, enumerables, hashes, nesting methods, government data, CSVs, parsing and more. I'm actually grateful that we were the guinea pig cohort for Headcount - it gave me a much wider lens into what went on in terms of the material.

I should also mention here that we helped improve the Markdown for the project with pull requests, as well as the test harness, so we acquired at least two "influence points." We also chose not to do the analysis layer since Josh asked us to help the groups that were struggling the final night, so I alone spent 3-4 hours with groups that were struggling over the course of the day, instead of working on that section.

Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Enumerables: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 3

#### Enigma

We really enjoyed Enigma as a team. I felt this was the first project at Turing where nearly the entire time I felt in my personal flow state and like the material I had learned came naturally to me and came into use. The stress of what is the project even asking me to do and will I be able to do it lasted only the first fifteen minutes actually. We were doing so well that by Thursday night a group of us in Foxtrot just talked through nitpicky edge cases and an unclear part of the spec, and I thoroughly enjoyed how we were able to have a very abstract, deep discussion about something that seemed totally foreign at the beginning of the week (the crack class and how one would construct any key to crack it, including possibly the original key). Made me want to go study cryptography.

Names: Sekhar Paladugu and Jhun de Andres

Github: http://github.com/sekharp/enigma

Notes:

* 49 tests.
* Some long methods, some opportunities for refactoring.
* Tests could use some edge case testing, and additional unit tests.
* Project complete, cracks in under a second.
* All features work.
* Constants could have been used more
* Decrypt/Encrypt and portions of crack could be pulled out and combined to
a single class.
* File IO could be its own class.

Evaluated By: Mike

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and can crack a 100-character message in under 1 second

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### Giving Feedback

#### Penney - Headcount

Penney was such a wonderful partner to work with. We had a slow and frustrating start on Headcount, where we struggled to figure our parsing, and we had no idea what the scope of the project was. At first my impressions were that Penney mainly had a confidence issue and, while she got the material, she would doubt herself and get too wound up to make progress on her own. The smart/not smart dichotomy didn't and doesn't seem like a helpful way to view people in general and especially at Turing. I gave her this feedback as we worked through Headcount and we continued to plug away as a team without major issues/miscommunication. I was away at a multiple day wedding all weekend in Texas which added to the project stress.

While she struggled at first with writing the methods/starting the coding, she put in solid work writing out the tests (hundreds of lines of writing), a dozen plus fixtures (which we never used), and laid the legwork for us to later easily test the methods as we wrote them. This set us up well and as we finish up the project I'm grateful for Penney's hard work in the beginning. During the final week while Penney did not pass her assessment and decided to repeat the module, she on the other hand became much more focused and calm and doubled down on the project, even though this did not have any bearing given that she already knew she was going to repeat.

I am so grateful to have worked with Penney by the end of this, which is the opposite of what I've heard many people experience working together so intensely under stress as a pair. Penney moved mountains to get all of the enrollment methods to work, and we refactored together with help from Lovisa and Torie and we have a solid final project coming together. Penney's leg work on parsing difficult/tedious issues that involved many difficult concepts (enumerable methods, hashes etc.) sorted out my own roadblocks. She clearly gets the material better than many of the folks passing Module 1, and knows parts of the material (TDD, etc.) better than me for sure. Thanks for everything Penney! This final stretch has been so much more fun that I imagined :) I'm proud of the work we've done and know you'll be an awesome professional programmer after Turing.

#### Shannon - Programming is Fun (In-Class Exercise)

"You carried this project through! I was super tired from having stayed up the night before to do Jungle Beat, and we were three hours away from a project-free weekend. But overall I thought you were diligent, willing to experiment/try new techniques, and push the project along throughout. I was a much less helpful partner given my mental state. Thanks for driving it along! We finished with a 90% complete/working project as I recall. <3<3<3 Keep up the great work! You are a great partner."

### Being a Community Member

#### Shannon/feedback from a programming exercise in class
"Sekhar has been my rock during this program. Any time I thought I would freak out, he would say something funny and put everything in perspective. During "programming is fun" I thought I would pull my hair out, but his ability to keep me level headed is the only reason we were able to get through it. Thank you for being a friend."

#### Penney/feedback from Headcount
"You are the kind of partner everyone wishes they had. I consistently felt supported and heard, and whenever the going got tough you easily and rationally talked us through it. Pairing with you on Headcount absolutely made me a better and more confident programmer. You are easy to communicate with, you were always making me laugh, you respected every personal boundary I needed along the way... this was an intense and difficult project that I ended up really enjoying because I got to build it with you. I am proud of this project and feel ownership over it in a way I haven't yet felt about any other project. Thanks so much friend!"

#### Torie/general feedback
"Sekhar has had a very positive impact on our cohort. He is incredibly supportive of all of us, and is always quick to offer a cookie, hug, or caffeine. He seems to pick up concepts very quickly and is very good at identifying the parts of a problem he needs to figure out. He has also played a huge role in bringing our cohort closer together through his friendly and upbeat personality and his efforts organizing events outside of class."

#### Lovisa/general feedback
"Seeing you always makes me happy, I can see that you are a real asset not only for your cohort but also people in the community. I enjoyed working with you and Penney the other day, it’s great that you trust yourself and the directions in which you want to take your code. Would love to work more with you!"

### Playing a Part

LGBTuring - created a new slack channel and internal Turing group where we organized a fun social outing attended by about 12-14 members of the Turing community, as well as a few friends and partners. Charissa had mentioned to me that she wanted to explore the gay scene in Denver, so what was originally going to be a double date turned into a fun night out at Hamburger Mary's and a drag show :) I think we'll do events twice a module or so.

Field Day - I drove a fun car of 1508 folks up to Loveland and we had a great day together. Highlights included
the moonshine we drank at a Cajun place for lunch (except for me, the designated driver!).

Welcome 1510 - Helping organize the incoming class welcome party.

Social events for 1508 - helping organize events in general for our crew/broader Turing community (Rockies game, etc.)

Stayed late and partly at Josh's instigation did not do the analysis layer of the final project in order to help groups that were struggling for about 3-4 hours Wednesday night, once my partner and I finished Headcount and had the full test harness passing.

Actually cleaning up on my posse duty during finals week...feeding Josh Cheek and John Slota...caffeine pill pushing...meme generating...
