# Fred Block - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal for Module 4 was to learn and implement more advanced JavaScript concepts.
To help accomplish that, I studied our reading assignments – and in addition, I picked up Rick Waldron's 'JavaScript Robotics' book for some more inspiration and guidance.
My personal project has been a blast, getting to apply the new concepts we've learned, and getting to play with the new technology in the context of hardware and the Internet Of Things.


### End of Module Assessment

#### Punch List

* [Production](https://infinite-shelf-2484.herokuapp.com/lists)
* [Github](https://github.com/blocknroll/punch_list)

I worked on the final project, but unfortunately did not perform at my best. I feel that I will benefit from reviewing and practicing more of the core concepts that this project revolved around.

* Delivered code is solid and very straightforward rails style
* completion is not up to par
* need to practice foundational rails setup and creation steps and tools
  more
* Should be able to fly through initial application infrastructure
  pretty quickly
* perhaps revisiting some tutorials or materials from earlier in the
  curriculum would help

Production: https://infinite-shelf-2484.herokuapp.com/lists
Github: https://github.com/blocknroll/punch_list

* __Features:__ 1: Missing more than two base expectations and/or the application is
  not deployed and working in production
* __User Interface:__ 2: The application shows effort in the interface, but the result is
  not effective
* __Testing:__ 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but
  fails to cover some features
* __Rails Style:__ 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC and pushing logic
  down the stack _or_ does not demonstrate and understanding of common
Rails conventions and best practices
* __Ruby Style:__  3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and
  clarity and often extracts logical components
* __Javascript Style:__ N/A - didn't get into the JS portions of the assignment



### Attendance

I happily attended all days and classes on-time this module.



### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:



#### Ideabox_jq

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blocknroll/ideabox_jq)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/4fdd6da8e2e431beeb77012e271de1eee90d5e07/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown
)

In this week-long project I implemented a basic CRUD app with AJAX and jQuery.

* Reviewed by: Lori
* Features: 1
* UI: 2
* Testing: 1
* Rails Style: 2
* Ruby Style: 1.5
* JavaScript Style: 3
* Loved: simplicity of design and interface
* Advice: Seek mentor support when you need extra explanations and guidance



#### HubStub

* [GitHub URL](https://serieux-bastille-5718.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown
)

In this week-long project I implemented various techniques to handle large amounts of traffic and a heavy server load.  The project is an extension and pivot of an existing app named HubStub. I implemented New Relic to first measure the existing performance of the app. I then added a a large set of seed data to simulate a heavy server load. Then, based on the performance feedback, I was able to find the most effective spots of the app to improve.

* Deployed to Heroku: Y
* Uses Newrelic: Y
* What is the average performance and traffic?  ???
* Required number of records seeded? Y
* Load Testing Script ???
* Performance Optimization Techniques ???
* Additional Features ???
(these from memory - not recorded in the ScaleUp evals)



#### Synthesis

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blocknroll/synthesis-mock)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/self_directed_project.markdown)

Synthesis is the beginning of a garden-automation project. The primary objective of the project was to work and explore the following new technologies:

Technologies:
* Node.js / Express
* WebSockets
* jQuery
* Raspberry Pi
* Johnny-Five

Learning Goals:
* Building a web application with Express
* Event-driven development
* Using WebSockets to push information to client-side applications
* Hardware integration with sensors

Scores:
* Completion: 2 - Developer completed most of the user stories and requirements set by the client.
* Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - Project shows gaps in test usage/coverage/design (85 - 90% coverage).
* Code Quality: 4 - Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
* User Experience: 4 - Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.
* Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.



## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:



#### (BlackJack)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/blocknroll/blackJack-1)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

The goal of this week-long project was to use client-side JavaScript to build a game that's playable in the browser.

Instructor Notes:
Game play had strange edge cases that didn't work
Poorly named methods that did not do what their names would have you believe

Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 2
* Fundamental JS and Style: 2
* Code Sanitation: 2.5



### Feedback to Me
The feedback I received was to reach out for help sooner and more often – as opposed to letting myself get hung up trying too hard to figure out something on my own.

From Lori:
You've made some good progress this module understanding JavaScript. Keep up the studying. I think you should pair with mentors multiple times each week. It's important to work with someone who can teach you while you are honing your skills.

From Tess:
Hey Fred! It's been really great having you with 1502 these last two modules. I wish I would've had the chance to work with you more. I agree with Lori about pairing with mentors. You can gain a lot even when you're not working on assignments.

From Patrick:
First of all, you helped me figure out how the commenting thing works! Most of all you've just been a great guy who even since module 1 when we were in the same posse were very welcoming and always had a positive attitude. I think you've come a long way and now are creating all sorts of IoT apps with drones and really advanced stuff. It's great to see.



## Community

### Giving Feedback

I try to give positive and constructive feedback as much as possible. I'm always happy when someone approaches me for feedback or with a question, and I try to keep an emphasis on an a positive, fun learning environment.



### Playing a Part

* On Friday, Aug 7, I presented a lightning talk "How to Fly a Quadcopter"
* On Friday, Aug 7, I organized a new 'Flight Club' group (complete with Slack channel!) and taught three fellow students how to fly it.
* On Friday, Aug 7, I shot photos of each of my fellow lightning-talkers while they gave their presentations. My goal is to start a new tradition of people helping to document each other's work. Hopefully these images will be useful for blog posts and social media.
* Being a coffee drinker, I try to clean up the kitchen area and coffee zone every time I use it.
