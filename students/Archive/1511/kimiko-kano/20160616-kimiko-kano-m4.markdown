#### Instructor Feedback

151 (141 + 10 for extension)/150

##### Specification Adherence

10 points: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. There is no use of format.js in Rails. There is no use of unobstrusive JavaScript.

You are a very strong team player. We saw your input and feedback all over the place on PR reviews -- it was great!

### Giving Feedback

For Chelsea Johnson: This was my first time working with Chelsea and it was an amazing experience. She was great at getting endpoints pushed through for Looking For either by communicating with the backend to get it done or more often, just deciding to do it herself and not worry about waiting around for someone else to finish it. This persistence to get things done is a great quality to have and she'll be well suited for her first dev job! In addition to her hard work ethic she's always a smiling and happy person, so she's just plain great to be around.

For Nate Venn: Nate took on two big tasks for LookingFor, testing the React components and pushing the app to production, both concepts that he had to do a lot of his own research on, as we hadn't learned how to test React components and getting the app into production required unique configurations that we hadn't dealt with yet. I was very impressed by how willing he was to challenge himself with taking on these tasks! Nate also has a super chill attitude and is really easy to work with, so he'll be an awesome addition to any team.

For Scott Firestone: Scott and I worked on Game Time together this module. I was really excited to finally get to work with Scott and it was fun to be able to create a game together that we both know and enjoy. I'm proud of the fact that we had narrowed our game choice down to two games and although the other game would most likely have been a lot easier to implement, we decided to push ourselves and take on the more challenging game. In the end I was really proud of the project we turned out. I hope that we can continue to work on it and make it even better! The only thing Scott needs to work on is to be more diligent about testing... and be more confident... and learn css... that's it. He's excellent at playing board games and we have a good rivalry going on there. I think the strategory that he displays in playing board games has transferred well into his logical thinking in coding. I'm pretty sure there is a link there. Scott is very hard on himself sometimes, but he is a great developer and I'm very confident that he'll do well in his career and hopefully start his own business some day!

For Ling Tran: Ling has a been a great moral support for me over the last couple modules. She always had positive things to say to me when she could tell that I was feeling stressed and she did of great job of cheering me up. I've paired with her a handful of times and can tell she has a good grasp of what she is doing and an enthusiasm for it as well. Additionally, even when she's stressed she's always able to put on a smile and laugh through any difficulty. I'm excited to see where her career takes her and wish we could have worked on something together (although maybe we will in the future!)

For Julian: The more I spend time around Julian, the more I both adore and admire him. He's an awesome developer, super quick and thorough, and a crazy hard-worker with all the time he puts into crafting his skill. He does a great job of teaching as well. This module he's been instrumental in helping out our whole cohort with learning JavaScript. Whatever team ends up getting Julian is very lucky and I very selfishly hope he ends up at company in Denver so that I can continue to hang out with and learn from him!

### Being a Community Member

From Ling Tran: Kimi is one of the most generous spirits at Turing because she is very giving with her time to support other students (including myself of course!). I've started pairing with her since my first module and am always learning from her, particularly on debugging techniques and cultivating a competitive state of mind to 'crush it'. While I'm sad to see her time at the basement come to a close, I'm excited for any team who gets to work with Kimi because she offers a lot on the hard skills front and herself simply being an all-around awesome person. They should count themselves lucky!

From Chelsea: Kimi was a rockstar on our Lookingfor front end project. Several times during the project, we would work on solving a problem without much success. Kimi would work on the problem overnight, and have a well-written PR the next morning. Her determination is not only evident in her code; it also applies to all areas of her life. For example, Kimi and I decided to arm wrestle (as you do). After several minutes of stalemate, I realized Kimi was not going to give up and I would have to be the chump that lost (and I definitely did). Any team would be lucky to have a solid developer like Kimi. Go Kimi!!!

From Nate Venn: Kimi has been someone that I have wanted to work with since mod one. Everybody that has worked with her had nothing but great things to say. She is always
smiling and giggling and I find that so comforting. I also knew she had a drive
to do her best and work collaboratively with her teammates. Finally, our last project at turing, I was fortunate enough to work with her on Scale Up. Its always
a fun time when you are working with Kimi. I would mention more about her technical skills but I think we all know how talented and smart she is. The one thing I will mention, is her amazing ability to pay attention to detail and give some of the best comments and feedback on code. Kimi is going to be an invaluable addition to any team.

From Julian: Kimi! Oh how I have loved having you as a friend for the past 7 months! Though it has had its rough patches, you've come out of Turing with the skills to be a developer. It has been awesome to see you grow from being tentative with your knowledge to being able to take charge and build out an application from scratch. Aside from programming, you have been a happy, funny and calming person for me during our time at Turing. Though I know everyone likes to think I don't stress out and I am always happy that is not always the case! Luckily, you seem to always keep a smile on your face even when everything around you might be burning to the ground lol. I know we are all tired and would like to take a break from  the craziness that is Turing, but I would encourage you to tackle the job hunt with force, because I believe you are going to make a great developer and I already know you'll make a great teammate! It's been fun Kimi and I look forward to see where you end up! Until the next Game of Thrones night!

From Scott: I finally had the pleasure of working with Kimi on Game Time. I found out very early on that Kimi is incredibly hard-working. I was sick the first few days of the project; while I’d go to sleep earlier, with or without all of my assigned issues completed, I’d find out the next day that Kimi stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning working on features. She challenged herself constantly, working with ES6 and tackling complicated view/game board implementation. Through the course of the project, I would get discouraged at times, and found out that Kimi is easily infected by the emotions around her, so that was sometimes challenging for both of us. I hope Kimi can become more self-confident and able to prop up teammates when they get down. Still, she’ll be an awesome developer no matter where she lands.
