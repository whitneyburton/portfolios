# Lee Chow - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> I wanted to feel comfortable consuming and building RESTful APIs. I also wanted to continue with a online machine learning course (Coursera, Andrew Ng) that I've been working on.

>* Overall, I thought it was a great module. I liked how Josh, Lauren, and Sal focused on getting us job ready. I really enjoyed them sharing their work experiences. It was great to learn about things we would likely see on the job (multitenancy, caching strategies, background workers, etc.)


-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects

> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* It was good getting used to Omniauth and the OAuth process with GitHub. It was good exposure to how to consume and API, and then later how to do this by breaking logic in Services, Presenters, Decorators.

> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* I really enjoyed building on my Parkinson's project from Mod 2. It actually gave me more practice with a "brownfield" project as I had to fix bugs and change the schema significantly. I also was able to build a simple Flask API in order to use scikit-learn and its machine learning modules. I was proud of that, and it was cool to see that I could learn the basics of another framework in another language. It was also cool to apply what I've been learning in the machine learning course to a problem. For next steps, I would like to try some caching strategies to optimize the app. Even further down the road, maybe building a front end in VueJS, and seeing how this could be deployed as a cell phone application.

## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* It was great working with Lauren on this. Learned a lot about building an API but keeping it RESTful. Also good practice with more complex SQL queries, and using ActiveModel Serializers.

> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* Haha, probably my least favorite project initially, but great practice in digging through an exisiting codebase. As it moved further on it was enjoyable to figure out some jQuery and AJAX on my own. Our team worked great together, was a pleasure working with these guys.

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Link To Gear Up]()
I enjoyed the Learning through Teaching Gear Up. The mod 4 students did a great job there and there was good student engagement. The career-oriented Gear Ups were super helpful, and I feel like I got my resume to a good place, and gained some good strategies for job searching.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
I have paired with some Mod1 and Mod2 students this module. I also helped lead the machine learning posse for a couple short-lived sessions.

#### **Posse**
Really enjoyed the machine learning posse, and we were about to get a project going. I hear this is going away though.
