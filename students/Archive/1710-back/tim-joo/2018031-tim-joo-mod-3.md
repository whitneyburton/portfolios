# Timothy Joo- M3 Portfolio
## Areas of Emphasis
  My goal was to learn how to build and consume API's, which I believe I was successful in. I became better at identifying opportunities for refactoring throughout the MVC framework, whereas before I was only comfortable with refactoring methods that had too much logic in them.
## Self-Assessment
| Section | Category | Score |
| --- | ----- | --- |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Work & Projects** | 2.5 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 2.5 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 3 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2.5 |

I thought I did pretty well on the final assessment and am proud of the work I did on that considering how badly I did on the mid module assessment. I took the advice of the instructors, told them I was going to practice for the final assessment and then went and did the thing. My group project with Rales Engine was really a great learning experience and learned alot about. Le Pivot really beat me up and took the wind out of my sails, but it was due to the amount of work that was involved in the project. My final project could use more cleaning up, but I intend to take the application and make it better through the break.

-----------------------
## A: Individual Work & Projects
> **[APIcurious](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious) (Optional)**
>* \<Great learning experience on figuring out OAuth and API construction on our own!>
> **[Self Directed](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/self_directed_project)**
>* \<Description>
>* \< I know I can build anything on rails, given the time. I had to work on diving into documents to find whats relevant for my situation and bust through it.>
## B: Group Work & Projects
> **[Rales Engine](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Mentioned my rails engine experience above.>
> **[The Pivot](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/the_pivot)**
>* \<Description>
>* \<Very mentally taxing, especially withthe introduction of git rebase work flow. I think we, as a group, probably spent at least a full work day figuring out what Git did to our work>

## C. **Gear Ups**
> [Link To Gear Up]()
\<Gear Ups had value to them, particularly the professional development curriculum. It's also good to hear insight and receive feedback about resumes and the mindset of job hutning.>
## D: Community Participation
#### **Community Contribution Option**
>* \<Link &/or blurb about the option you chose (blog post, lead a spike or posse, lightning talk, open source contribution or pair > 3 times)>
#### **Posse**
  >* \<We just did personal work time>
  >* \<Nothing, it has changed so many times since I've been here I just consider it personal work time>
  >* \<In a past posse life, I did get to have Regis Boudinot come speak to us about the process of contributing to an open source project, so that was the most valuable part of my overall posse experience.>
#### **Playing a Part**
> \<I did some mentoring for Mod 1 and Mod 2 students.>
