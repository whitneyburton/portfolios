## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

  Mod 1 was a bit of a struggle for me as far as managing the workload, stress and change that was going on, so one of my goals this mod was to manage my time better, focus on really understanding the content and giving myself some code/life balance. I found in mod 1 that allocating some non-coding time for myself to regroup and recharge was really helpful so I wanted to make sure I was doing that form the beginning. I think I was definitely successful in my goals. This mod was a lot less stressful and I felt good about my efforts and strategies to understand the material. I allocated time on the weekends to exercise and watch TV to take a break form coding which really helped me mentally recharge. My confidence dipped a bit mid-mod but I was able to identify my weakness and focus on improving that area for the last couple of weeks of the mod. As for content, I really feel like I can understand and execute Rails apps. I am also excited to be able to solve problems more quickly by reasearching answers and implementing solutions efficiently now that that I have a broader understanding. I felt like this mod really affirmed by decision in chosing Back End. I really enjoyed everything we learned. 
   
What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

  I probably struggled most with styling this mod. I came into the mod with a basic understanding of HTML/CSS but it turned out to be a lot less then I thought. I didn't anticiapate how difficult it would be to manipulate things on the page and even come up with decent color schemes and details. It became frustrating at times and even using the bootstrap I struggled to really use it to my advantage simply because I didn't know all its intricacies. I learned that HTML/ CSS takes some serious practice and I should probably practice more!

## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite project was probably ideabox because it really showed me that I could create something from start to finish. I liked touching every part of the project and I felt like it was good for my confidence to have been able to successfully implement (almost) all of hte functionality. The one peice that was missing I now understand why it wasn't working! My least favorite projectw as probably job tracker mainly because I struggled to implement some functionality (queries). I think it would be more fun to do now that I know a little bit more and can make the app more useful. 
  
What did you learn from your independent projects?

  I learned that I am definitely capable of completing a project on my own with all the required functionality! It was a confidence booster to have some independent projects that could realistically be completed, whereas I felt like mod1 it was really challenging to finish all iterations of a project independently (or at least it was for me!). I learned a how to research errors and implement solutions into my project and I learned a flow to  project creation that made sense for me. 
  
  
What did you learn from your paired projects?

  I liked our paired project much more this mod. I liked working in a group and felt like I could actually contribute equally which was really nice. Feedback is still hard to give and receive but it was good to have some practice with that. I learned that I'm good at keeping track of the details and organization of the requirements of the project. Especially in Little Shop where there are so many details it's important to keep track of them so they don't get lost in the greater functionality of the program. 

## Community

What was your favorite Gear Up? Least favorite? Why?

  My favorite Gear Up was probably The Attention Economy. I thought it raised some important quesitons as developers and was really informative about what the indsutry is doing to keep consumer's attention. It highlighted the balance between business and ethics and I just felt like it was a good discussion. I don't have a least favorite. I felt like the gear ups were good this mod. 
  
How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

  I was an SAB representative this mod. I tried to keep our mod up to date on the happenings in the community. I also tried to attend lunch/social groups when I could. I attended Imposters and JCS a number of times. I attended the Code Fair and SAB social. I also tried hard to connect with people in mod1 and chat with them. I didn't feel strong enough in Ruby to be super helpful with coding but I did feel like I could offer moral support! I also really tried to chat and connect with mod2 front enders more this mod. 

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

  I would like to increase my participation in some of the student groups. I would really like to take advantage of the Cold Outreach group if that continues. I definitely find that challenging so I think that would be beneficial. I will not be the SAB rep so I hope to still participate in all the events and support the new reps efforts!
