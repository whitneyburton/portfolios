### Your Mission

My goal for this module was to get a better feel for javascript and to start to understand how the skills I have gained at Turing related to the outside world. As I had told Allison during my interview with her, my confidence in my coding abilities fluxuated during much of my time here.  Part of this was due to feeling like, within the walls of Turing, no matter how much progress I felt I was making, I didn't feel that I had the skills necessary to do this job and was one of the weaker coders at Turing when compared head to head with other students.

In mid December of 2015 I was given an opportunity to start working with a pre-revenue startup in NYC that one of my wife's friends is a cofounder of.  They had a consultancy in NYC build the application for them about a year ago.  But after they had not received an update for several months, while still paying for services, they ended the contract and in calling me to ask if I knew anyone who knew Ruby on Rails, I ended up agreeing to work at 3-month contract for them, to prep the application for a pilot and subsequent launch in Q1 of 2016. Whether the project continues is contingent on funding.

The application is a healthcare application, designed to help patients share documents with their doctors. To this point I have swapped out payment engines from Paypal payment integration to Braintree payment processing, reset triggers for mailers and took over development project management, assisting the CTO with updating and managing the product backlog as well as updating CSS and javascript styling.

If it's possible, I would be more than happy to show the work I've done on this application, if it could be considered as points towards my total score.

What I learned from my experiences outside of Turing is that Turing has more than prepared me to be a software developer and in the last few weeks I have finally found the key to pairing my previous experience with what I've been learning and that has lead to a new found confidence in my abilities.

While my scores for this module don't reflect, in principle, what I have learned, or my capabilities, my confidence comes less from scores and points and more from what I've accomplished.  I wrote a core websocket application in 5 hours.  I didn't finish the final assessment, but did manage to write nearly 800 lines of code in 9 hours yesterday.  These are thinks I could not have done a year ago when I began this program.

If the decision is that I have not performed well enough to "pass", which I expect may be the decision, while I don't intend to return to take the fourth module at this time, I am grateful for my experience here and the hard work and dedication of the staff and would hope that I would be welcome to come back and audit a class now and then.

### End of Module Assessment

50 Points out of 125

Comments included some logic that I include in the views should have been in controller.  Yes, I agree with this assessment, but given the time constraints I made the trade off of pushing for completion of features vs refactoring to perfection in the go.



### Attendance

I didn't track my attendance but I did miss several days due to family, work or travel.  I began my job hunt and exploring other work options and as a result had a several phone interviews in the afternoons of several days.

### Work

The work for this module was interesting.  We had a couple of larger projects and then a number of homework assignments.

As of this writing I accumulated 592 of 1269

### Projects
#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/idea_box_js_four)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

##### Description

This project is the spiritual successor to Idea Box, but there is no requirement that you need to have done or even be away of Idea Box to be successful on this project.

Every developer has more ideas than time. As David Allen likes to say "the human brain is for creating ideas, not remembering them." In this project, we'll be building a simple application for recording and archiving our ideas (good and bad alike).

Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server.

##### Evaluation Comments

Don't recall, and can't find them listed anywhere.  I am guessing they thought it was amazing.

##### Evaluation Scores

Could not locate Scores

##### Team

Solo Project

#### GameTime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/snake_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

#### Description

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.

This project is inspired by Minicade.

##### Evaluation Comments
I don't recall comments and could not find scoring.

From a personal standpoint, I elected to work on this project solo, and in retrospect, that made it much harder to complete.  I did pair with Meeka and Lovisa through the project with was very helpful. However at the end of the day, I was unable to deploy a completed project.

The problem that I had was when it came to deploy to the webpack framework Steve had given us to start with.  I had built most of my project in a scratch file and had difficulty transferring it to the webpack framework.

Despite having not deployed a completed project, I do think my Object Oriented JS was solid as I did grasp those concepts and felt comfortable with them, having self studies Object Oriented JS in the weeks before returning to start Module 4.

At one point I had difficulty with the speed of the snake, and had decided if I couldn't slow it down, I was going to call the project Crack Snake.  Solved the problem so Snakey went into rehab.

##### Evaluation Scores
I am uncertain where to find scores.  But what I got is included in the score listed above.

#### Mini Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](n/a)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/scaled_down_scale_up.markdown)

#### Description

Follow the tutorial below. We will not always go through code implementation in detail but rather demonstrate how to identify bottlenecks, strategies of data caching and fragment caching and how to improve performance of our application.

##### Evaluation Comments
n/a - I was unable to get the project for this set up working and didn't get it done.

##### Evaluation Scores
n/a

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/real_time_four)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

#### Description

Every project that we've done so far—with the exception of Game Time—has been bound by the whole HTTP request/response cycle. In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

You will choose the approach that you feel works best.

##### Evaluation Comments
Horace gave me some good feedback on my project, pointing out that I had build a solid base to the project in a constrained time period.

What was not captured in the feedback was the the constrained time frame was 5 hours.  I started the project at 9:00am the day of my evaluation and had my assessment at 3:30pm.

##### Evaluation Scores
101

## Community

### Getting Feedback
Robert has a great systematic approach to programming, and his methodical inclination helps him to work through places where others may get bogged down. He is also a pleasure to engage with in conversation, which we’ve done on several occasions.  To improve, Robert would benefit from not locking himself into his system all of the time, and taking regular breaks to step back, look at his code, and decide when he’s holding on to tight to a piece he doesn’t understand, or a piece that doesn’t fit into his system. Programming yoga. Be flexible.

### Giving Feedback
No one asked me for feedback, but I would have gladly given it had it been asked for.

### Being a Community Member
This module was difficult because I came into a cohort that had already been together for three modules and was pretty established.  I never felt unwelcomed, but I did keep to myself for the majority of the module.

### Playing a Part
One of the biggest things I've done is work to support people trying to get jobs.  I have referred several former and current Turing Students to jobs that I have been approached about.  I pass Zach, David and Vanessa's names to a recruiter for Arrow Electronics and recently sent her Jeff R's name as well, despite having not heard back from her myself for the position I was interviewing for. In addition to passing the recruiter names of students, I made and email introduction to Jeff Casimir to her, as she had mentioned she had been talking to gSchool and I told her Jeff would be able to connect her with more students as she said she was looking to hire 100+ in 2016.

I have forwarded emails to students who I know were looking for jobs as well.

I was recently having a discussion with a friend of my wife, who was working with programs in DC to place Syrian Refugees in jobs.  She and I started talking about industries that were in need of help, I mentioned that there was a need for software developers.  She told me that there were several refugees who had computer science backgrounds but needed help finding jobs.
I strongly support what Turing is doing, and made and introduction to Jeff Casimir to Sarah to discuss it further.  Sarah told me the other day that the conversation went very well and that she was excited about the opportunties that may come out of me having introduced her to Jeff.
