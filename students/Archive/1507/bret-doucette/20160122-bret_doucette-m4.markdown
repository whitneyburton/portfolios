# Bret Doucette - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For this module, I wanted to become comfortable with JavaScript and more comfortable with algorithmic thinking. Game Time helped with both of these. I also redid two projects from module one (Linked Lists and Mastermind) and wrote blog posts on topics that confused me (sessions v. cookies, n+1 queries, and time in Rails).

### Attendance

This module I attended all days but one.

### Individual Projects

In module four, I completed the following individual projects:

**Feedback to me**

Per Regis:

Bret is quite the character. He is always finding the strangest bugs and seems to enjoy tracking them down. While he does spend an insane amount of time encountering bugs that none of us have encountered, he also spends time helping people fix other issues. He has become an excellent debugger and his javascript skills have surprised me.

The only negative I have for Bret is that he can go get lost in the back of classroom A and when he gets stuck he doesn’t reach out for help.

Otherwise Bret has been a great contributing member to the cohort and turing itself!

Per Deborah:

Bret found me floundering and stuck with Linked Lists and took the time to pair with me. He helped me understand some complex topics by talking through the logic with some of the most entertaining and useful dry-erase marker scenarios the world has every seen. He made me feel confident and never once emphasized what a newbie I was. Bret seems shy, and a bit self conscious but he was my hero on Linked Lists.

Per Mimi:

“Bret and I chose to work together for Game Time because we knew we would work well together and complete an assignment we would both be proud of. During the project I was not my usual pleasant self, but that didn’t phase Bret. He went above and beyond to get the project done. Bret is always willing to put in the time and effort necessary to complete a task. He is determined - almost stubborn - to figure out a problem and to understand it thoroughly. I’m going to be sad not to have the opportunity to work with him again!!"

Per Dave:

Bret’s understanding of MVC principles and his ability to quickly learn new technologies is a source of inspiration for me. An example of this is his adoption of Zombie for testing his websockets app. He was able to implement it, try it out, then trash it and switch to a totally different system all in a couple of days. I admire Bret’s dedication and work ethic, as evidenced by his git commits and the late hours I see him put in regularly. I would not hesitate to have him on any team I am a part of.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

To Mimi:

This was Mimi and Bret’s second time into the depths of hell. The first was Sales Engine - the second was Game Time. For  this project, we choose to work together so obviously I have no complaints. It was once again a pleasure to work with Mimi - she is a refactoring goddess and managed to make our project go from a tangled mess to a beautiful being. She was also a debugging and structuring wizard.

To Deborah:

I paired with Deborah on Linked Lists - she was enthusiastic, hard-working, and responsive. It was a pleasure working with her. She asked clear and articulate questions and when faced with a challenged worked diligently through it. I enjoyed paring with her and would like to again!

To Dave:

Out of all the people at Turing, Dave is the most inspiring person here. His work ethic, dedication, and diligence are inspiring.  I really enjoyed having him as an addition to our cohort. I hope to have his work ethic and dedication going forward. I remember how at the Christmas Party he told me how he does each warmup over and over again day in and day out. This is but one of the many examples of his work ethic. DAVE is awesome!

To Chris:

Sadly I never got to pair with Chris on a project. I didn’t realize this until late in the program. I was in a deep dark hell hole of JavaScript and Chris helped me out of it. He didn’t have to, but spent 2+ hours with me, helping me debug an issue I had for the previous 28 hours. He is selfless and awesome. I will miss working with him.

To Regis:

Regis is one of the most enthusiastic people I met while at Turing and one of most inspiring. The Regis from module one (where I believe he struggled a bit) to the Regis of now is like a whole new person. His knowledge of dev ops and his passion for learning about an assortment of dev ops related materials is amazing. Not only did he teach himself all these things, he selflessly taught other people. I can remember being in my own wormhole of code in regards to the asset pipeline in Rails. Regis took time away from his own project ( when he had little time to finish it) and help me. Thank you Regis.

One area of improvement would be he sometimes can more difficult than they need to be BUT he always sorts it out in the end - though I also do this...
