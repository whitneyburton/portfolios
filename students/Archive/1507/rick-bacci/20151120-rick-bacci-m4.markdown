# Rick Bacci - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
  I came in to this module with a plan to stay focused.
  I want to continue to work hard and finish strong.
  Switching to programming with mostly JavaScript stressed my ability
  to do this.

* Incomplete

I was very excited to start this project because websockets was something
that I attempted to implement in our game-time applicaton.
I decided to use Node and React for this project, and it turned out to be
a mistake. There were too many new things on the table and I should have
kept it simple. I did use waffle for this projects requirements, although I
need to re-evaluate the way I break down building an application.

I felt like I was on the verge of understanding how React worked multiple
times during this project. That proved to not be the case and it cost me the
MVP. I attempted to start over using JQuery and made a lot of progress, but
I ran out of time. I need to find a better way to judge my progress.

I am glad that I challenged myself by using React but I lost site of the
target...a working application.


#### Scale Up

Instructor: Tess

   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RickBacci/keevah)

Would have loved to see for browse if other than the first page was hit due to pagination

Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 3
Load Testing / User Scripting: 3
Database Load: 3
Performance Optimization Techniques: 3
Additional Features: 3

I was really excited to start this project because it's a different kind of
problem. Trying to increase the performance in this app was very challenging
for me. Often a page was still the slowest after tweaking something making
it difficult to choose a path.


## Team

### Projects

    I was a part of one team project.

Ricky and David

Functional Expectations: 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one
                          extension
Test-Driven Development: 3: Application is well tested but does not balance
                         isolation and integration tests
Breaking Logic into Components: 3: Application effectively breaks logical
                                components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
Fundamental JavaScript & Style: 3: Application shows strong effort towards
                                organization, content, and refactoring


## Community

    I do my best to help anyone that asks.
    This I something that I enjoy. Feels good to do it.
    I did not pair with any students this
    module.
    I did work weekly with 2 mentors.

### Giving Feedback

    I didn't have an opportunity to give feedback. I do however offer it when I think its
    beneficial throught the module.

### Playing a Part

    I try to pass on what I know to others. Helping others feels good especially
    when I'm stuck on something. I also tried to pass on any tips or tricks
    that I have learned, and generally be available for others. Helping others
    gives me a solid gauge on how well I understand what I have been taught.

## Review

### Notes

- Final project not completed.
- Major issues with final assessment.

### Outcome

RETAINED - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and you may either repeat the current module or leave the program
