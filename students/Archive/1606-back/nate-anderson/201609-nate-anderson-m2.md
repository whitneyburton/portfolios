### Areas of Emphasis

In Module 2, I set out to build upon my Ruby knowledge while also diving into everything Ruby on Rails has to offer. Learning the backend for web applications, as well as delving into the database side, has been very gratifying in terms of being able to see what I am building up on a browser. 

### Mid Module Assessment

Evaluator: Casey

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

Conceptual Understanding
3: Developer is able to describe concepts with a moderately high degree of specificity and accuracy with some assistance/questioning

Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

Feature Completeness
3: Developer is able to implement all functionality and all tests pass

Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

Rails Style
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

Testing
4: Developer understands errors produced by tests, and uses them to drive development independently

Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### End of Module Assessment

* Nice way to break out percent calculation. May have gone just *slightly* overboard in terms of the number of different methods included.
* Like that you talked through what data needed to be created for the first test.
* Needed some prompting to get the proper data for the test.
* Got stuck implementing the second task.
* Be sure to use your tests/errors to drive your development. Don't get stuck in your head. Use the tools you have to get more information about why your app isn't behaving as you would expect (pry/byebug/save_and_open_page)
### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
* 2: Developer can execute an algorithm or plan when steps are provided
### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring
### 3. Rails Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance
### 4. MVC & Rails Style
* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack
### 5. Testing
* 2: Developer struggles to use tests to drive development
### 6. Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback throughout the process


### Work

These assignments built off of lectures and solidified my understanding of the different concepts we encountered this module.

#### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [Github URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

Robot World was an app where we built different robots and assigned them images. It put into action our basic understanding of CRUD and allowed us to build all functionality. Also, it was the first time we were really able to put our newfound HTML and CSS knowledge to use. This project taught me more in depth how the flow of an app works. 

#### Blogger

* [Github URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Blogger was a long tutorial in which we built a simple blog system and went through building an app from scratch. This was very useful for me as knowledge base was able to grow with the MVC model, creating migrations, routing, and getting an introduction into partials and helpers.

#### MixMaster

* [Github URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/mix_master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

MixMaster was a long tutorial that we worked on over a weekend. It was an app where we kept track of songs, artists, and playlists and also implemented users. I was able to get familiar with Heroku, start using RSpec, understand relationships more, and implement authentication. 

#### Rails Mini Project - IdeaBox

* [Github URL](https://github.com/NateAnderson1780/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

IdeaBox was an app to record your ideas. We were taught the basics of deploying with Heroku and also reinforced our CRUD knowledge. Many to many relationships were also implemented, which proved to be a little trickier than one to many. Authentication was used again as well as authorization, which we used for the first time. This project brought a lot of the concepts together for me.

## Team

### Projects

These team projects set a goal to solidify our knowledge of concepts in building out an app, while also being able to successfully work with different people with different ideas. 

#### Rush Hour

* [Github URL](https://github.com/bcgoss/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was a Sinatra based project that allowed us to track visitors to various websites. It deepened my understanding of database relationships. Also, it allowed us to get an introduction to ActiveRecord, which was very confusing at first, but once I got the hang of it, it was very useful and powerful. It was also our first group project of the module and gave me a chance to strengthen my skills working in a group. 

## Evaluation

1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development
2.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

6. View Layer
3.5: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.
3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Workflow (NOT GRADED)

3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.

## Feedback to me

Project Feedback from Susi Irwin: Your calm demeanor and analytical thought process made this project way more enjoyable to work on. You were always there to cheer us on, say positive recognition, and make sure that we kept the end goal in mind. Your Iteration 2 method work was a HUGE breakthrough for our team and our project and seeing you smile when you figured out the rankings of top 3 items was awesome. In the future, I would love to hear you speak up even more and really get your thoughts on the tough spots.

Project Feedback from Bryan Goss: I felt very comfortable being on a team with you. You worked diligently and helped keep things moving. You helped to set clear expectations at the end of each session about what we should do separately and have ready for next time. I can think of a couple times where I don't know your opinions or thoughts. Part of that is definitely because I talk too much. In addition to that, I think you could offer your opinions more. Some times I felt like Susi and I were talking a lot and you let yourself take a back seat. On the other hand, I think you were the most centered member of the group and I appreciate that you worked well with Susi and me even when we were not as calm and focused as we could have been. Thanks for all your work on this project, it was a very positive experience!


#### Little Shop of Orders

* [Github URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/little-shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop was a project that brought together all the concepts we learned this module to build an e-commerce site. TDD was emphasized as well as solidifying our knowledge of relationships. HTML and CSS were used more than in our previous projects to build a pleasant user interface. Goal was to use Agile to build a logical workflow throughout our app. Our app was named Turing Antiques and we sold items that were found around Turing. 

## Feedback to me

From Ben Pepper: It was a pleasure to work with Nate during the Little Shop project. Nate’s persistence in getting any problem completed was inspiring. He was always willing to take up any task that needed to be handle and alway had either a question to further the project or insight that helped us overcome a problem. There is only one thing I would recommend. The only thing both Nate and I agreed on was styling sucks. This is the one area I would say we both need to work on. the Rails side is relatively easy but style had us both confused and it would be worth it to take some time to learn boot strap.

From Calaway: Nate has been a great asset to our group on our Little Shop project. His communication has been excellent, which was apparent from the initial DTR. He has a good gauge of his own abilities and knows where he can have the most impact on getting the project done and helping the rest of us understand it. His knowledge of the material is very evident when working with him and his ability to learn new concepts quickly and apply them immediately is impressive. I would consider myself lucky to pair with him on any other projects in the future.

From Brendan Dillon:  I worked with Nate on our Little Shop project. Nate is skilled at being able to solve problems with really clean, efficient code. It is very apparent when working with Nate or looking at code that he has written that he puts a lot of thought into the design and structure of the code. He also is great at putting his head down and getting a lot done in a short amount of time. The only thing for Nate to work on is figuring out what questions to ask when somebody else is going through their work.

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Susi Irwin: You made me smile on a daily basis and definitely helped make everything lighter in some of the more tense moments of the project. The organization you displayed kept our team going in the right direction and made our workflow that much more smooth and easy. The analytics tables in the views were a work of art and added some aesthetic flare to the project that I would not have been able to do. I would like to see a little more confidence in your knowledge as you added a lot to the project, but that is something I believe will come with time and experience. Overall, wonderful partner and I really enjoyed working with you.

Feedback to Bryan Goss: Bryan was a great partner. The knowledge he brought to the project was a driving force and he always took the time to explain things that were a possibly a little unclear to me. He is very dedicated to doing things efficiently and making decisions that will benefit the flexibility of the project in the short as well as the long term. I think he could benefit from a little more patience when encountering differing viewpoints but overall he was a great pleasure to work with.

Feedback to Calaway: Calaway was a great partner in Little Shop. He took on the role as project manager and kept us thoroughly organized and on task throughout the duration of the project. He always pushed himself to full understanding and would break everything down into smaller parts to see how everything fit together. The only thing I would say is sometimes he maybe gets a little too hung up on these smaller details, but that is nitpicking in a lot of ways. I really appreciate his contributions to the project and would be happy to work with him again.

Feedback to Ben Pepper: It was great to work with Ben again on a group project.  Anything that he takes on, he dives deep into and learns everything about it that he can.  He was always willing to go the extra mile as well whenever we split up work. Also, he never shies away from learning something new. The recommendation I would give is one that I have given before, and I do think Ben is getting better at this, is to just not be as hard on himself as he is sometimes. He is a very good programmer and sometimes I wish he could see it himself. But other than that, he was again a great partner on another successful project.

Feedback to Brendan Dillon: Brendan was a great partner in Little Shop. He always had many ideas to push along our progress in the project.  The creativity he showed when solving problems was always impressive and his work ethic is second to none. Also, his help in the styling was huge to the group as a whole as us back enders struggled to push ourselves past this portion of the project. The only thing I would recommend is to speak up a little more often. His ideas were always valued but I felt like at times he would hold back a bit. But other than that, he was a fantastic partner and I would be happy to work with him again.

### Being a Community Member

From Jean Joeris: "Nate was a great partner. He understands how he learns best and communicates that clearly. He is very self-aware, and advocates for himself in effective ways. He isn’t afraid to question someone's logic, or ask for time to digest and think about the code. He could improve his refactoring skills, but he is aware of that and actively works to improve them. Nate is a kind and caring person that has been a joy to work with. He is encouraging to partners and I'm glad I got to work with him.""

From Raphael Barbo: "Nate’s progress this module is beyond measure. He is one of the most dedicated, hard-working people I have ever known. Nate has an amazing personality, always with a big smile on his face, and one of the humblest attitude in the game, I am super happy to have shared another module with him, and can’t wait what this awesome human being accomplishes during the upcoming modules."

## D: Professional Skills

The great thing about Turing is that they care as much about molding a great person as creating a great programmer. Social issues take the forefront on Fridays as we learn about the different problems facing our industry in the current day. To be able to traverse these problems and hopefully lessen them and create empathy is huge in being able to contribute positively in whatever future job we may acquire. 

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This Gear Up I think was great for everyone at Turing. The reading especially made me feel comforted in the fact that other people were feeling the exact same things that I was. The struggle to learn new things on a daily basis can be very intimidating. But having confidence in yourself and never giving up can give you the strength needed to make it through. 

#### There Is An I In Team

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

This was a very interesting discussion that dealt in team dynamics. For a team to be successful, every team member needs to feel empowered to speak freely without judgment. Empathy needs to be present and all ideas should be considered fully and with appreciation. 

#### CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub Gist URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

The video we watched was very eye opening as it dealt with a lot of the prejudice and intimidation women in tech receive on a daily basis. It taught me that I should speak out the moment I see something that I feel is wrong because women most of the time do not have the power in numbers that men have. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://gist.github.com/NateAnderson1780/6c579d6a0b910ff3392e446747723207)

This session taught me a lot about how to structure my social media platforms so as to maximize the number of potential employers that can find me. It was very useful in building out each area in terms of specific information that should be included about myself as well as some of the aesthetics that these different platforms should have. It also provided me with strategies about which people to follow and how to structure an inquisitive email to someone possibly inquiring about oppportunities or just a way to strike up a conversation that might lead to something more. 

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
In both my group projects, we used waffle extensively and it really worked great.  It is a great way to keep the entire group organized and be able to plainly see everything that is on your table ranging from things to do through things that the group has finished. As we all became more comfortable with the site and its association with github, we were able to create custom labels that helped even more in categorizing our priorities. The only thing that didn't work perfectly is sometimes in Little Shop we would have multiple cards for the same thing but that is a minor problem. Another strategy was different pairing techniques. Switching off who was the driver was great in a group of 4 people. Everyone was able to get their hands on the code at different times. We also worked as group, in pairs, and individually which also worked well but I felt like I was missing what the other pair was working on sometimes when we separated. But this was mitigated by check ins and explaining what the two pairs had separately done. 
2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.
Feedback is always tough to give but very important to be able to grow as a developer and a person. The criticisms that I received were delivered very delicately and I tried to take them to heart as much as possible.  I received comments about speaking up more during Rush Hour so I tried to be as active as possible during Little Shop and I believe there was a very noticeable difference and it definitely increased my confidence to be more vocal.

#### Networking with Lia

This session with Lia was very interesting. It gave me a lot of motivation to attend meetups and gave me great strategies on how to interact with people once I am at these meetups. It taught me that I don't need to be around the same person the entire night and to practice leaving gracefully once the conversation has reached it's natural end. Also, to contact the people you have met in a quick fashion so as to leave a lasting impression and show that I am serious about my career development. 

### Playing a Part

I worked with various Module 1 students weekly in pairing sessions and screenhero time. Also, I joined the Turing pre-work guides to help incoming students with anything they may need clarification on.
