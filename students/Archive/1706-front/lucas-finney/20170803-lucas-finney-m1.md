## Areas of Emphasis

This module I wanted to obtain a solid grasp of the core principles and concetps of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I knew that learning JavaScript was going to be the most challenging of these three languages, so I put extra emphasis on understanding it's foundational components.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module I completed four individual projects: three static web pages and one number-guessing game web app.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/lf-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

In this project, and all other Static Comp Challenges, I was tasked with recreating a static website, adding responsiveness so that the page would work well on a wide range of screen sizes ranging from a large, wide-screen television to a small, mobile phone.

For this particular project I tried to maintain the zeitgeist of the original comp and pick one person to focus on. I chose the stand-up comedian Bo Burnham. In this project I was able to practice many of the fundamental HTML and CSS concpets we had been learning in class, namely sizing and positioning elements and controlling the position of content of those elements. In this project, I also implemented grid layout, which was not covered in class. While I was able to learn the basics of grid design, there were some flaws in in how my page contents moved as the page size changed, namely with the images I chose stretching at odd times. I did make an effective shift to a different format for a mobile device, thought. Overall, this project helped me to solidify my understanding of basic HTML and CSS.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/lf-comp-challenge-2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This project's comp featured a number of cards, seeminlgy for some sort of business socia media site, but I saw it as working well with a sports team of some type, so I chose the Denver Broncos defense for my content. I arranged the cards similar to how the defense would line up in a 3-4 defense. I initially wanted to use grid layout for this, but based upon my end desired goal, flex display proved to be a more effective solution. I also experiemented with fixinga a heading and how to use flex in conjunction with margins to space elements in the same container out on opposite sides.

#### Static Comp Challenge 3

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/lf-comp-challenge-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-3.html)

This was the final static comp of this mod and certainly the most challenging. I implemented a host of strategies to arrange and move the various containers around the DOM mainly through use of both grid and flex layouts. This page also featured hover states on buttons, which I hadn't experiemented with before on this large of a scale. I also used a fixed backgronud image that maintains form as the page around it changes which gives off a neat visual effet as the user resizes the page. While the mobile format is quite busy, I am happy that I didn't need to hide any of the original containers and could manipulate all of them to effectively fit on the page (the excpetion is the main nav par links, which seemed fair to hide).

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This project we were tasked with creating a game that generated a random number between 1 and 100 that a user would attempt to guess while receiving hints from the app on how close they were. This project was quite challenging from me as it was the first time I ever attempted to implement JS to interact with the DOM and link a number of function together. If one looks at my repo they will notice how unrefined the files are even as simple as the naming conventions as I have two difference .js files and don't follow common naming conventions. In the .js files one will notice a host of global variables and many places where code could be refactored. I may refine these at some point, but felt it important to keep the files intact for now as it helps me track my progress as a developer.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Over the course of this mod I had the opportunity to work on several projects with partners that helped reinfe my HTML and CSS skills and build up my JavaScript skills.

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

The Linked List project tasked me and my partner with creating a web app where a user could create a list of websites they frequently visited. This project was my first partner project involving coding, so there was an extra element to learning how to effectictely tackle a series of coding problems with a partner. This project introduced the contcept of appending and subsequently removing items from the DOM, which proved to be the most challenging aspect for me.

##### Partner Feedback
```I was very proud of the work we did on this project. I thought we worked very well together and complimented each other. I learned a lot about CSS and using dev tools by watching your work flow. Your instinct to go straight to dev tools for adjusting CSS was a huge strength for our team. I also appreciated that you were super-flexible with our working style and quite accommodating of my need for personal space. Your adaptable personality is very easy to work with, and also very disarming, but it also leads to a more organic workflow which is not necessarily as productive as a more rigid timeline of goals and mile-markers. I felt like I was doing the bulk of organizing the workflow. Don't worry, this was not at all a disadvantage for me or our team, just something you might find holds you back in the future. We were quite fortunate that setting goals and organization is my strength, and you definitely brought an equal amount of strengths to the table, if not more.```

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lfinney/ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Idea Box was probably the most challenging project for me during this mod. It significantly increased the rigor in regards to the various actions we needed our program to execute. Additionally, this project required us to use git hub throughout the entire process. Both of these elements to the task proved challenging for my partner and I, and while we might not have implemented some of the more advanced features of the projects, we had complete understanding of the ones we did implement in addition to getting to a competant level with the use of git hub.

##### Partner Feedback
```A pleasure to work with you Luke! You have a great energy and personality, which makes you an easy and motivating partner to have. I also appreciate how you set limits for yourself and others. Remaining determined and focused while not inducing a stressful environment. To be honest, I don't have any areas of opportunity for you to work on, but for the nature of this "feedback" I'll put something in... perhaps your coffee making skills could use a little bit of work, Ahah! Just kidding! Coffee and tea was delicious! For real though... the only thing I can think of is white boarding more frequently and drawing out the logical order of functions and the process. I need to really work on this as well, and is one area of opportunity that would benefit both of us in the future. Again, it was great working with you Luke and I appreciate the ups and downs we traversed to get our project to the functioning point it resulted in!```

#### ToDo Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alexbanister/2dobox-pivot-3)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

The last project for this mod was unique amoungs the other JS-based projects as it involved refactoring other students' programs, pivoting the type of program it was, and then adding on additional capablities. This project proved to be a good learning experience for me in a different way than the other projects were, as my partner was significantly stronger than I in terms of his coding abilities. He was an excellent thought partner and helped me improve my problem solving skills when things went wrong.

## D: Professional Skills

This mod prodvided the opportunity to enage several professional development sessions, called "Gear Ups" that helped me reflect internally and seek ways to improve as a person and coder.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindest

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

Having worked as an educator for the previous six years, the session on Growth Mindsets was based around a corpus of knowledge I was already quite familiar with. I try to always channel a growth mindset, and this session helped ground me before the rigor of Turing really kicked in. It was nice to be reminded of the course ideas of growth mindset and reflect on how my own growth mindset has evolved over the past six years.

#### Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

This gear up session helped me to realize the strength of my ambivertism. It was a bit eye-opening to observe how a vast majority of my classmates identified as significantly more introverted than extroverted. In regards to this, I reflected on how my my ambivertism cna be a strength to help me effectively work with individual who identify more introverted.

#### Storytelling and Strengths

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

I have had a reputation for being quite the talker my whole life, but this gear up helped me to consider how being good at talking doens't necessarily equate to being a good storyteller. I appreciated the space to reflect back on my whole life to determine how some of my strengths were developed. Think back in this regard gave me some perspective on why "Input" was ranked as my key strength as it has been a common thread througout my whole life.

#### Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

Watching the above named documentary and engaging in discussion with my classmates on its content was a great opportunity to stop and consider my privelege as a straight, white man. It made me think a lot about my wife who has had some analogous experiences in the legal community to those shared by the women in the film. Overall, I think it's important that be both an advocate for desconstructing not only the gender gap, but the other rifts in society that cause some people to benefit unfairly than others for reasons that can be strongly corrleated to their income, race, culture, etc.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part ###

I was given the privelge of serving as a student representative to Turing's Student Advisory Board this past mod. It was certainly more challenging than I anticipated it being for two reasons. First, it was difficult to keep the role and its associated tasks in the forefront of my mind while also working on school work. Second, it is challenging to be a representative voice of a large number of people, and I hope that I did a fair job of representing my cohorts thoughts and feelings. I will be serving as a representative again next mod and hope to improve in my capacity to meet both of these challenges.
