4 - Zero complaints

### Workflow

3 - Developer(s) make many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of the application but sometimes contain irrelevant changesets and inconsistent commit messages. Developer(s) use git branches and pull requests when applicable to incorporate changes into the application, and are not pushing fresh changes directly to master. Pull requests may contain little or no code review. There may be slight instances where the developer(s) have committed source code that should be .gitignored. There may be some instances of “dead” or commented-out code and debugger statements like console.log that need to be cleaned up.

# C: Professional Skills

## Gear Up
### Microaggressions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)

A reflection on micro-agressions, this Gear-Up provided a good opportunity to reflect on the everyday interactions I find myself in and how I can better be aware of others' identities. This is an important topic for us all to consider as our world becomes "smaller" given how connected we all are thanks to technology.

### Tragedy of the Commons

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/tragedy_of_the_commons.markdown)

The Parable of the Paragon was a thought-provoking medium through which to view and discuss diversity. The way in which the statistics on something as small as neighbor preference were displayed and interactive for the user not only caused me to reflect on some of my own choices, but also have ideas about what I can build with the skills I'm gaining at Turing.

However, I think this Gear-Up's title needs to be changed, because the "Tragedy of the Commons" is a specific economic problem, and not what this Gear-Up was about.


### Mod 4 Lead - Toxic Masculinity in Nerd Culture

This Gear-Up attempted to have us dive into a rather vast issue, being masculinity prevalant across all types of nerd culture. I engage in interesting dialogue with my classmates, but I think we all found that the issue was much bigger than we initially thought as we talked it out.

# D: Community Participation

## Playing a Part

I maintain a google doc of mod-specific resources for my classmates to use as we go throughout the mod.
Paired with lower mod students on a few occasions.
Helped re-start my posse.
