## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We had two individual projects during MOD2: Sorting Suite and CompleteMe.  I really enjoyed both of the individual projects and the way my cohort worked together to get through the projects.

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NikBorn/Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

Individually and collaboratively we wrote the following sorting algorithms: QuickSort, MergeSort, InsertionSort, and BubbleSort.


Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3.5: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Functional Expectations

3: Application meets all requirements as laid out per the specification.
Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4: Zero complaints

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NikBorn/completeme)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

We created a search tree with autocomplete functionality.

Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3.5: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Test-Driven Development

3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects were challenging, but we were able to complete them after a lot of hardwork.

#### Gametime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NikBorn/gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

we made a version of the popular game flappybird.

Functional Expectations

3.5 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs Application crashes during normal usage
User Interface

User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
Testing

Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
JavaScript Style

JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.
Code Sanitation

The output from JSHint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Case Study-Edward Snowden

* [GitHub URL]()

It was very interesting to learn more about Edward Snowden and the leaks he made about NSA Surveillance.  Most of the discussion revolved around the fact that we would not, under the same conditions, create the leak, because of the backlash that he has had to deal with.  However, we did all conclude that it was the correct thing to do to let the public know about it.  Edward Snowden is a villain to some and a hero to others.  


#### Parable of the Polygon/Automation

* [GitHub URL](

I felt that this was a very effective Gear Up and it provided us with a great visual representation of what can happen when people have even a small amount of prejudice.  Likewise, it exemplified how having an open mind can lead to much more diverse ideas and opinions by not being afraid of those who are different than we may be.  I also felt it was a great way for intermod interaction and I enjoyed meeting a few classmates that I had not had the pleasure of meeting yet.



#### Empathy

* [GitHub URL]()

I was not apart of this Gear Up session, I left at lunch that day.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I participated in the Code Fair and I also paired with several MOD1 students to help them with projects and mythical creatures.  Below is some of the feedback that I received:

Dan Alvarez - Hey Nik, thank you so much for your help with pairing. You were very helpful especially when you didn't know why one of my test wasn't passing, and you went and found Joe in your class for reinforcements. It meant a great deal to me knowing that even though the problem had stumped both of us that you were willing to find the answer for me even during the time limit of lunch.

Margo Schaedel - Nik was a great pairing partner. He was prompt and eager to talk out the logical processes behind some of the problems I faced in the javascript functionality on my projects.  He made suggestions and guided me in the right direction without simply handing me answers.  He was more than happy to explain concepts that I did not understand and I really appreciated that he alway made himself available to answer questions or work with the mod1 class.

Michael Marlow - During several pairings, I really appreciated your calm demeanor and focused approach to working through the different problems/questions I brought to you. Getting your perspective and seeing some of your workflow helped a lot; some of your tips had never occurred to me but saved me heaps of time (fixing flex-box issues in media queries!). I have a tendency to kind of roam off-topic but you helped minimize that during our pairing sessions. One thing I noted during our pairings was the time-boxing wasn't as efficient as it could've been; In future pairings I would suggest touching base with them to really narrow down what you need to bring to the session so you can jump right into the problem(s).

Ralph Burnette - Hi Nik, thanks for paring up with me on Mythical Creatures.  This is a subject that I struggled with first time around.  Thank you for slowing it down and working through them step by step it was very beneficial for me to hear your approach on the testing.  Thanks for your help, very much appreciated.
