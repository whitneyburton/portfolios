Created a personal resume website.  Built a REACT version and Javascript version.  Built over the course of four weeks with weekly evaluation meetings from working Front-End Developers.  Brenna Martenson, Louisa Barret and Jeff Duke.  Project is still in process.  Published to Domain name: jasonlucasdeveloper.com.

* [Head Count)](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/HeadCount2.0)
* [Head Count original assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/headcount2.0)

HeadCount 2.0 is a project designed to challenge your skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components.

You will start the project by importing files containing various educational stats from districts within Colorado by year, per district.

In the spirit of TDD we have created some unit tests for you to start off with. These tests will help you break out calculation logic into a DistrictRepository class. After you finish iteration 1 you'll move on to creating the rest of the react application on your own, with the expectation that you will continue to test the application on your own.

This application was built using the create-react-app boilerplate. This boilerplate provides a lot of build in content and dependencies for free. Take a few minutes to read through the documentation, and remember to refer back to these docs if you run into unexpected issues.

# Instructor Evaluation Points:
# Instructor: Jhun
# Comments:

## Specification Adherence

- 3 - The application completes 5 iterations.

## Code Quality

- 3 - Developer appears comfortable in React demonstrated gaps in knowledge of how the tools should be used and/or the app contains unrefactored code.


## PropType Implementation

- Pass - Proptype validation is implemented for any component receiving props.

## CSS/Design

- 4 - Developer has made a targeted effort to make the app appealing and user friendly. Evaluator has minimal recommendations for design changes.

## Testing

- 3 - Almost all components are tested to a level that indicates developer has an understanding of testing



# SWAPI Box

* [SWAPI Box)](https://github.com/jasonlucas907/swapi-box)
* [Original SWAPI Box Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/swapi-box.html)

For this project, we are going to work on developing some muscle memory building out React components. At this point you’ve built at least one basic React app in the past. Now’s the time to leverage that and add some complexity.

For this project, we will be hitting The Star Wars API to tap into a “black hole” of Star Wars data. Mwahaha.

# Movie Tracker

* [Movie Tracker](https://github.com/anajauregui/Movie-Tracker)
* [Original Movie Tracker Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker)

This project is working off the The Movie DB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - note you'll need to go create an account to get an API key). The idea of the project is to be able to sign in as a user and save favorite movies. Pretty simple right? HA HA not!

Bc this is still in beta here is what you'll need to know.

# Instructor Evaluation Points:

**MOVIE SPEC**:

### Specification Adherence  

* 3.5: The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

### Redux Architecture

* 3: At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.

### Routing

* 4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.


### JavaScript Style

* 3.5: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.


### Testing

<!-- * 4: Project has a running test suite that exercises the application using Enzyme. The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application including the Redux actions and reducers.
* 3: Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
* 2: Project has sporadic use of tests at multiple levels. The application contains numerous holes in testing and/or many features are untested.
* 1: There is little or no evidence of testing in this application. -->

### Workflow

* 4: The group effectively uses different Git branches, submits pull requests and reviews each other’s code. The evolution of the application and who was responsible for what features is clearly documented through github.


# Audio God

Audio file manipulation App.

**Project:** Self Directed
**Students:** Travis & Jason
**Instructor:** Limbo

## Completion

4: Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set in check-ins in timely manner.

## Organization

3: Developer is amazing.

# Technical Quality

## Test-Driven Development

3: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

## Code Quality

3: Project demonstrates solid code quality, proper abstractions, and reduced duplication.

# Product Experience

## User Experience

4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

## Performance

3: Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

# To Dos:

* Finish the visualizer
* Move un-neccessary classes into functional components
* Make library selection persist with CSS change to show which is selected

### Bonus:
* Track selection visual queues somewhat unclear
* persist track selection with CSS/banner
* Add fun effect(s)?

Failing Gracefully

One of my failures

When I was 30 years old I was a successful self employed artist.  I had worked extremely hard to get to this point.  I was living in Denver making a solid six figures, had a nice house, big loft art studio downtown, worked whenever I wanted and traveled and got to travel all over to gallery exhibits and client commissions.  I had made it.  Then the economy crashed in 2008 and people stopped buying art.
Within two years most of the galleries and art consultants that I worked with were out of business.  I was broke, I closed my studio and my lawyer wanted me to file for bankruptcy.  I had failed.

How I dealt with it

I was very frustrated and very upset.  Everything that I built was gone.  I decided to focus on how years from now when I looked back at this what kind of person would I have liked to have been?  What would the person I would be proud to have been do?  How would they handle this?  Then I made a game plan and worked at becoming that person.

I didn’t file for bankruptcy.  I took a job in Alaska working a mile underground in a mine.  I spent two years there.  I paid my debts and put my life back together.  It was one of the most humbling experiences of my life and one of the greatest learning experiences of my life.

What I learned

Looking back, my perceived failures have always set the foundation for some of my greatest experiences and successes.  I think if you can have faith in that you can be fearless to pursue anything.
