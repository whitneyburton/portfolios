## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Blog Post:
> [Ruby on Rails ](http://www.sergeylukyanenko.com/ruby-on-rails)

#### Tutorials: Blogger & Mix Master
> During this tutorial I learnt how to deploy an app to Heroku, write model tests using RSpec, write feature tests using RSpec and Capybara, use branches and commits to develop git workflow, model one-to-many data relationships, model many-to-many data relationships, use factories to create objects to use in tests. It's been very usefull and productive tutorial.

#### Projects: Job Tracker & Rails Mini Project
> During Job Tracker Project I practiced in views, partials, and helpers. Used RESTful routes. Used migrations to create tables with different data types including indexed foreign keys.
It's been a good practice of adding functionality to this application.
> In Rails Mini Project I paired with a partner to explore the idea of "Turing Store Project". Where we practiced white boarding, brainstorming ideas together and then practicing coding on our own.

## C: Group Work & Projects

**Bike Share**
>Bike Share is week 1 project. And good start for mod2 where we had a chance to paractice Ruby, Sinatra, and Activerecord to build a site

**Little Shop of Orders**
> In this project I learnt to use TDD to drive all layers of Rails development including unit and integration tests. Design a system of models which use one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. Practice mixing HTML, CSS, and templates to create an inviting and usable User Interface. Practice an agile workflow and improve communication skills working within a team.
Practiced working with Waffle and writing comments in GitHub.

##### Feedback to me for Bike Share

  >* From Ken Lee: Sergey, I’m glad we had an opportunity to work on a project together. You always kept on the positive side and always wanted to learn. You took the opportunity to say I don’t know and can you explain what’s going on. Those moments helped me learn more because I was thinking the same thing but did not ask. You willingness to take on hard problems and keep on it until it was completed is admirable.

  >* From Riley Thompson: Working with Sergey on Bike Share was a rewarding experience. I enjoyed his willingness to collaborate and share his ideas so readily, which helped to keep a steady work flow through out the project.  I was impressed constantly by Sergey’s work ethic and focus. His determination was inspiring and helped me push through some tough spots in our project. I would be willing to work with  him in another setting in an instant.


##### Feedback to me for Little Shop

  >* From Colleen Ward: Sergey, I really enjoyed working with you on our Little Shop project. You have a excellent understanding of rails that really showed in this project. Your CSS skills were also phenomenal, and I personally really appreciated how much you took on related to styling. I also really enjoyed your sense of humor and I thought it added to our group dynamic! Overall, I think you were a great partner and I’m really proud of our project and how our group worked together.

  >* From Craig Ness: Sergey, I really enjoyed our time working together on our final group project of mod 2. I was truly impressed by your willingness to tackle new challenges like css styling, and volunteering to take the lead while coding together. Your calm demeanor helped our group to remain cohesive and your positivity helped to make the project enjoyable to work on. Having a team member like that really helps to make the group function better as a whole, and I appreciated the fact that you were rarely frustrated. I was also impressed by your ability to focus in on the details of the code—you always seemed to be able to spot the parts of our code that would throw an error before any of us could, and you were great at coming up with solutions to solve them. Overall I really enjoyed having you as a partner, and would welcome the opportunity to work with you again. Good luck in the next mod!

  >* From Beth Knight: Sergey really tackled the design side of our project. It looks amazing because of the work he did. He also volunteered to drive a lot. Open communication, great teammate.

## D: Professional Skills

#### **Professional Development Workshops**
> [Warm Outreach, Agile Process, Feedback]
https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/deliverable_submissions/1701-b/sergey_lukyanenko.md

#### **Gear Ups**

> [Empathy](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)
 In this gear up we discussed what we can each do, as individuals, to stay connected.
 And I define for myself importance to be open, trustfull and to be more inolved in school and cohort activities.
 In this discussions I learnt to be attentive to being respectful, active listener.

> [Grit](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/grit.markdown)
In this gear up we discussed how grit come into play and if we have been able to strengthen it
I find studying is a positive growth. And I believe the more challenges I have on my way the stronger I become.
Sometimes there is a big project. And the most difficult part for me to not see it as one big challenge, but to be able to break it down into pieces and work on it step by step.


> [Automation](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)
One of the main questions we discussed during this gear up was How serious an impact do you think automation will have on our economy from now until you retire?
I keep thinking about automation and what role do we play in it as programmers
I think we have an opportunity to make the world better place for living
