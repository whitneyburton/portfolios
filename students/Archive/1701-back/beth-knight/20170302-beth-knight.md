# Beth Knight - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Repeating this mod, I wanted to focus on TDD. I think I really learned a lot and it's how I've started every project, which was a huge help.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

*   Project 1 (Erin Bassity): Night Rider

```
Dear Beth,

 I loved working with you on this project. I felt like we shared a similar
 approach to how to tackle the problem and it paid off with a successful
 and satisfying assessment. I appreciate your commitment to me as your partner
 and to this project.

Your strengths include:
	Super positive
	Flexible attitude
	Easy going
	Resourceful (you are very good at finding answers, and getting unstuck and
	finding help when needed!)
	Creative approach to testing and coding
	Patient

One thing to improve on (and we talked about this), is your approach to
"throwing spaghetti" on the wall, but I think you advocated for yourself
really well in asking to focus on TDD.

Awesome all around!

<3 Erin
```

*   Project 2 (Stephanie Bentley): Black Thursday

```
Dear Stephanie,

	You were such a great partner! You were there everyday working right beside me for the past two weeks. I appreciate you coming in on the weekend to bust this guy out. I never felt we had any communication problems. We ended up programming most of it together which worked out really well because we could catch little mistakes that could have held us back. I think you’re super strong with the enumerables, which is a difficult concept to grasp.
	I guess the only feedback I have would be to take a step back when we’re super stuck and maybe reach out for a new pair of eyes. I do the same thing where I start “throwing spaghetti at the walls”.
	Thanks for being my partner! I really enjoyed our time together!

	Beth
