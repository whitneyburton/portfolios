## Self-Assessment Scores

Fill in how you would grade yourself from 1-4 in the following categories this module.

| Section | Category | Score |
| - | ----- | - |
| A | **End-of-Module Assessment** | 3 |
| B | **Individual Projects** | 3 |
| C | **Group Projects** | 2.5 |
| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Community** | 4 |

#### Notes

* I believe I still have room to learn a few things. However, considering how sick I was for the last week of class and durring assessments, I believe I did well enough to prove my progress.
* I believe my overall scores in my individual projects and assessments represent a strong 3 when averaged accross the board.
* I have 3 children and a 4th child due in about 8 weeks. Despite heavy responsibilities at home I have still put in over 60 hours a week on my education. I have contributed to my community by helping classmates where I can, supporting others who needed friend, creating silly events for the class to participate in together and doing my part to bring people together. I have been truly overwhelmed by my current list of responsibilities but feel I've managed them well considering the load.

------------------------------------------------
## A: End of Module Assessment

| Category | Result (pass, fail, pending) |
| ----- | --- |
| Pairing Assessment | fail |
| Independent Timed Assessment | fail |
| Diagnostic | fail |

* My assessments have all shown that I can easily achieve a 3 in conventional ruby style and a 4 in colaboration. I also have received 4s in mastery of git and GitHub using frequent commits and pull requests. I obviously understand the logic and what I'm supposed to achieve but can be a bit slow at communicating the proper code toachieve the outcome I envision (which is typically the desired outcome).
* The code I write is consistently improving and is of good quality. The fails on my end of module assessments are really only due to time constraints. If given the opportunity to figure something out or find the help I need, I always achieve the goal. Sometimes it just takes a little longer. Keep in mind I've been coding for a total of 7 weeks.
* In the paired assessment I got all 3's, a 4 and a single 2. The 2 was becasue I was 1 or 2 lines short of completing the iteration. Given a little more time I will become quicker and I don't think that this single 2 should constitute a fail.
* I could have easily finished writing all required tests for the "bon_appetit" exercise and achieved a better score. However, I built the tests line by line while following the spec, as to not "write too far ahead". If I'd known that simply writing all the tests up front would have guaranteed a better score, I would have done so.
* I nearly finished iteration 2 of "bon_appetit". You will notice I have commented out an enumerable block I was near completing in the "add_to_shopping_list" method of the pantry.rb file. I believe that some credit should be given for writing the enumerable. I commented it out to allow the rest of the program to run correctly after submission. I didn't want to submit completely failing tests due to 1 bad method, hence commenting it out.

#### Notes

* In the project "Enigma" I believe the evaluators comments should be recognized, mainly:
  + strong use of helper methods
  + great pair work - loved seeing the dynamic of raising each other up and making sure each is on the same page.
* In the prohect "Headcount":
  + simplecov set up with 100% coverage

### Pair Feedback

#### Project 1 (Enigma - Ben Ross):

**Feedback for Ben Ross:**

Ben,

It was one heck of a week and we came out looking pretty darn good. Mostly due to your fantastic grasp on the Ruby language. Even as someone with just a few months of exposure to the language, you're making strides that I am truly envious of. Throughout the time we spent working on our project, I was constantly impressed with your drive for completion. Although our goal was not necessarily project completion, you took that challenge very seriously and put in long hours to achieve a working version of our program. I did experience many moments where I couldn't follow the pace that you were moving at, which mostly stemmed from nothing but an enormous knowledge gap between you and I. I've seen your desire to see others succeed and your character proves that you're just as focused on others as you are on yourself. As your knowledge of the Ruby language deepens so will your proficiency in the knowledge of "next level" pairing with other individuals from all skill levels. I would highly suggest that you double down efforts to recognize when your partner might be lost to the point of disconnection. We truly experienced a few tense moments, yet we both came out the other side with a project we could both say we truly contributed to in our own meaningful ways. I appreciate the learning experience we shared and the friendship that we've been able to launch throughout that time. I look forward to the chance that we will collaborate again in the near future and using the lessons learned on this endeavor to make the next project an even more focused and exciting growth experience for both of us. Keep up the great work and never be afraid to step out of your comfort zone!

Your partner in code,
Joel Lindow


**Feedback from Ben Ross:**

"I know that you have a lot on your plate Joel, and I respect the fact that you are at Turing putting the time and effort in to improving your life, and the lives of everyone in your family. Kudos. I know you feel like this material is really difficult to understand. I think that that's how it's going to be for a lot of us, for a while. I saw many things clicking with you towards the end of our project, it was great to see. I saw how smart you are when you dig into a subject and how enthusiastic you become. You really gave our partnership a lot of energy at the end when that was just what we needed. Keep it up. I guess for the sake of giving you something to work on in terms of pairing I will mention one thing. When you started to have concepts click and you were getting ideas about what needed to happen, your energy level was quite high.  While it was difficult for me to juggle complex ideas in my head along with your exuberantly delivered suggestions, I will say it also injected some much needed spirit into the situation.  Also, most of your ideas were spot on. So if I were to give any suggestion at all, I would say, be aware of the multiple affects your excitement has while coding, and apply strategically."

#### Project 2 (Headcount - Padraic O'Neill):

**Feedback for Padraic O'Neill:**

Padraic,

I've really enjoyed getting to know you better while we've worked on this project. I've spent more time with you in person or online than I've spent with my own family and now it feels like you're almost a cousin or a long lost brother. I'm always impressed by your knowledge. When you or I hit a dead end it seems we can find eachother a "way out" and a place to continue on. I think, given the crazy circumstances we both encountered during this project, that we still complemented eachother's working and learning styles better than could have been expected.
I would encourage you to keep pursuing refinement of test driven development. You're doing great work and I think that even better tests will push you far ahead of the pack in your abilities.
Thanks for all of your hard work, patience and inspiration. It's been a fruitful experience. Keep up the great work.

Joel Lindow

### Gear Up

#### Session 1 - Growth Mindset
A fixed mindset is terrified by the "tyrany of now"/ A growth mindset is focused on the process, growth, effort, strategies developed and perseverence. The difficulty of things and effort they take to learn can make you feel stupid but they can also cause you to grow.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

As the video said, "It sucks to spend all your time sucking at something". This is why sometimes you must split up huge chunks of learning into smaller bits of learning that you can process one by one until the big picture comes back into view. Some pieces will be to big to split up (which is deffinitely the way I think and learn) and that will cause those things to take longer to learn. However, given enough time you can learn them. However, you only have so many congnitive resources available and once the "tank" is empty... that's all there is and it's time to rest. In retrospect, I wish I'd had more time to rest throughout mod 1, but there was simply too much to learn.

#### Session 3 : Strengths and Storytelling

It's one thing to want to do something. It's another to be DRIVEN to do something. Through knowing my own strengths, my reasons and needs for a change, my values and knowing how I demonstrate my values it makes the journey a lot more clear and rewarding. When you are able to see yourself acting upon those values daily, and those around you also recognize the same things, it helps to cinfirm who you are, what you're doing and that you couldn't have done it any other way so you need to keep going!

#### Session 4: Debugging the Gender Gap

As a white male who has had very little "privelege" in his lifetime, it was hard for me to personally identify with this film. As a father of an adopted daughter I already hold the values of a man looking to give women and underroveleged people every advantage I can, even if I have very little of my own to give. I met my wife when she was pregnant and abandoned and wanted to make sure that I was a part of helping her and her child both have an advocate and partner throughout the rest of their lifes. I agree with the film, regarding the need to push for equality among all genders, ethnicities and lifestyles. I want to see all people have a fair and equal shot in life. But that does also include me wanting to also achieve things for myself, even though I am a white male, which seems to be the opperssor according to certain mindsets. I refuse to see myself that way because that's not who I am. I'm a human being. We all are. We all bleed red, and we must all stick together. We must create a well rounded society, workforce, educational system and community for eachother. We can not raise up one people group by tearing another down. All people and opinions matter and must, at a minimum, be taken into consideration.


#### Session 5: Strengths and Storytelling Reflection

After 5 weeks at Turing I didn't feel like a different person. However, I was a bit more aware of who I was and how that effected how I learn and interact. It explains why I'm so quick to uderstand some things and so slow to latch on to others. It explained why I am so hung up on worrying about the wellbeing of classmates in need even when I, myself, am struggling as hard or harder. It also reconfirmed for me that this isn't about me "getting a high paying job" as much as it is for me to gain a very relevant jobskill that I can take into the world and share with others who might not get the opportunity to learn otherwise. I've always been a string advocate for bringing in and hiring unskilled people that can be educated and grown to a greater value on the job. I still believe that the skills I'm learning in Turing will allow moe to help people in a similar fashion once I'm proficient and back in the workforce.
