DOM manipulation, AJAX returns, how JS works with promises. 

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?
More pairing with my project partner would've been ideal, but my partner had a personal emergency come up so that left me to work on project and partner with others.

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?
see above answer

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

Issues deploying a vanilla JS to a production environment with env variables, creating a chatbot, integrating text to voice feature.

## Open Source Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What codebase did you contribute to?
Spree library

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
Trying to deconstruct and understand the codebase. We couldn't test the bug in a live environment.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
We tried with writing a test and pinpointing where we would place our solution.

* What did you like the most about the challenge?
Reviewing an elaborate codebase and trying to understand a piece of it.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
Setting up env, good documentation is key, good protocol for communication and contribution to an open source project.

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?
Communicate challenges and issues arising with work or personal life immediately with instructor staff.

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?
Challenging to organize this whilst busy with everything else in mod 4. It was an interesting experience as we chose a good topic.

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?
Provided humor to classmates. Very instrumental in easing stress.

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?
Communicate with tech lead , be open and honest about capabilities/constraints, providing good documentation.

## Professional Development
 
* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md): https://github.com/vaidashi/career-development-curriculum/commit/1a61dfeff48598ba3ecab01f23373036d0270f26
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
