# Jennifer Peavler - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to obtain a firm grasp on the structure and uses of javascript and jQuery.  Particularily I wanted to see my code become more clear and eloquent as the module progressed.  I wanted to become more proficient at CSS and develop a more refined sense of design.

## A: End of Module Assessment

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### CSS Static Comp Challenges

I completed a series of static comp challenges this mod.  A picture of a comp was given to me and my task was to recreate the
image.  Creative liberties with regards to copy, images, icons and color were taken; however the design and layout integrity was to be kept in tact.

#### Number Guesser

For this project, I built a number guesser game.  The game generated a random number, and the user had to guess this number.
The original assignment is shown below along with the application that I built.

Evaluator: Louisa

##### UX/UI Expectations-3 
Application shows strong effort towards matching the comp, but some details have been missed. Any extensions are simple, clean design, content organization, and well thought out experience and user interactions.

##### Functional Expectations-4
Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

##### Fundamental HTML-3
Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing and has incorporated accessibility best practices.

##### Fundamental CSS-3
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Fundamental JavaScript-3
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and proper syntax


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

#### Linked-List

For this project, my partner and I built a web address bookmark generator.  The user could enter the name and URL of a website.  The application validated the url and appended a bookmark card to the page.

Evaluator: Robbie

##### Functional Expectations-3.5: 
Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two.

##### Fundamental JavaScript Style-3.5: 
Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

##### Workflow-2.5: 
The developer makes large commits covering multiple features that make it difficult for the evaluator to determine the evolution of the application.

##### HTML Style-4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

###### CSS Style-3: 
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

#### Idea-box

For this project, my partner and I built an idea card generator.  The user could enter the name and content of an idea.  The application appended an idea card to the page.  The user could then rate the idea or delete the idea.  The idea card and the information on the card persisted upon page reload.

Evaluator: Louisa

##### Specification Adherence-3
The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### HTML Style-3.5
Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

##### CSS Style-3
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### JavaScript Style-3
Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

##### Workflow-3.5
The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

##### Collaboration-3.5
Team members employ PRs and issues to both manage their work and communication/collaboration around executing the tasks.


##### Feedback from my partner:

Working with Jenn was a solid experience. We communicated fairly well and often enough that we were typically on the same page.  We struggled on a few aspects of the project, but it was Jenn who would take the first step back to break the problem down into much more simple tasks. This proved to be the most valuable part of the experience as I have a tendency to take on too much at once.

##### Feedback to my partner:

Dave communicates expectation and roles clearly.  He is approachable and adaptable.  He has a solid understanding of the subject manner and is able to express his thought process clearly.  He works relentlessly to get the job done, and takes pride in his work.  In order to grow as a developer, it is my recommendation that Dave keep up the good work, but perhaps sometimes, take a step back from the project and look at the flow of the application as a whole.  This will enable Dave to be able to understand how to break up the whole project into smaller, more attackable functionality problems.  Can’t wait to work with Dave again, as he most definitely rocks.

#### 2Do-Box-Pivot

For this project, my partner and I took the code repository from another pair of students 'Idea-Box' project.  We refactored the code and altered the functionality in order to suit a task-to-do card generator application.  We were also tasked with creating some selenium testing for the application.

### Gear Up
#### Growth Mindset

*   [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

It was interesting to think about the people in my life and which ones tend to have a fixed mindset versus a growth mindset.  For me, the biggest take away was to recognize that some people DO have fixed mindsets.  I have a growth mindset.  I am always looking for ways to improve things, find solutions to problems and learn.  So the thing that I walked away realizing, is that some times people don't always want solutions to problems.  Some times, people just want to share their story or vent and the best thing to do is listen and learn from them what I can.


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was a member of the SAB and I lead up the LGBT Turing Group.  I also reached out to students who needed help with course work.  I participated in Lunch Roullete.
