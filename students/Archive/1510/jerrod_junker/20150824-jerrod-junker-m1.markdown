Areas of Emphasis

At the beggining of this module I needed improvement on my ruby skills and my communication. I did a lot of after school studying on the fundamentals of ruby and now feel fairly strong with it. Every time I was paired I set out to improve my communication by talking through my thought process. now I feel that I can communicate my thoughts much more easily. Goals for the future are: Talk to more mentors, do more programming, and doing stuff that involves my posse much more than I have in the past.

End of Module Assessment

* Good start with setup
* Try not to think too far ahead
* You get the syntax but it just feels like you need to write MORE CODE
* Please get into Exercism and similar small problems
* Need to push to the breaking point

Work

This module I worked on these projects:

Robodoku

https://github.com/Unsafepond/Robodoku
https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown
We'll build a program that can solve an valid Sudoku puzzle.

-"uses a random insertion technique"
-"no objects pulled out of solver"

Functional Expectations: 3
TDD: 3
Encapsulation: 1
Fundamental Ruby: 2
Enumerable: 3



Linked List

-https://github.com/Unsafepond/Linked-list
-https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown
-Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

-"30 tests, all pass"
-"Tests are trending to a good place, need a bit more with the edge 
cases and some are hard to follow"
-"Implementation has some good code reuse, other spots where it's missing"
-"Missed some features because JC was slow in pushing the spec changes"

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 2
Encapsulation: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Looping / Recursion: 3

Team

Projects

This module I worked on these pair projects:

Enigma	

https://github.com/Unsafepond/Enigma-new
Original Assignment
-In this project you’ll use Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

-"No cracking"
-"Like the "function objects" ie decryptor"
-"The binary was nice"
-"When something is difficult to test, identify what is making it difficult and push that higher in the callstack "

Functionality:
Score: 2
Fundamental Ruby & Style:
Score: 3+
Test-Driven Development:
Score: 3
Breaking Logic into Components:
Score: 3+

-The feedback I got on enigma is to slow down and make sure my partner is up to speed with exactly what we're doing.


Sales Engine

-https://github.com/Unsafepond/Sales-engine-v2
-https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown
-In this project you'll practice building a system of several interacting Ruby objects using TDD.

1. Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness

  2. Test-Driven Development
  * Tests looked a little sloppy and could have used better refactoring, but the
    suite was extremely thorough, robust, and broken into the correct files.
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation
  and integration using appropriate data

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  * No use of modules, but the logic was where it needed to be and as pushed
    down the stack as they could manage.
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
  principle of SRP

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  * Several quirky things caught my eye, but no serious violations to mention.
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and
  refactoring

  5. Enumerable & Collections
  * Caught on to the best enumerables by the deadline, but did not get time to
    implement them or demonstrate their understanding of when to use which.
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

  6. Code Sanitation
  4: Zero complaints

  -The feedback i got on sales engine was to try to voice my ideas earlier on, but otherwise hardly any complaints.

Community

  Mike W.- I said he was very receptive to ideas, but was maybe a little agressive about driving.

  Jeff R.- I said he was also receptive to to ideas, but he needs to voice his ideas and to communicate more in general.

Playing a Part

-Occasionally picked up trash around the basement.

-Helped multiple groups with enigma.

-Helped Jeff and Tyler with a Git problem

-helped Justin Pease with sales engine

-helped Adam Jensen with sales engine 3:30 A.M. - 5 A.M.
