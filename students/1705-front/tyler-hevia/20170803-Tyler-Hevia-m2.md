# Tyler Hevia - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to keep improving my Javascript muscle memory, learn more about Node and how to use it to set up projects, get more comfortable with my GitHub workflow, get a handle on React, and start adapting more of a test-driven development mindset.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: Pass
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: Pass
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: Pass
* **D: Professional Skills**: Pass
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: Pass

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Passed.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I thought our two individual projects really helped me get more comfortable with building and manipulating data structures.
## Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/TH-Sorting-Suite)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html)

  * Wrote a bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort with help from my instructors and classmates.

  * Eval with: Nathaniel

  * Passed

## Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tylerjhevia/TH-Complete-Me)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/complete-me.html)

  * Built a trie and populated it with a ton of words, then used it to create a simple web page with autocomplete functionality.
  * Eval with: Limbo
  
### Scores: 
### Fundamental JavaScript & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all requirements, and implements one extension properly.

### Code Sanitation

The output from ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

### Instructor Comments: 
* More testing! Test the little things, edge cases, etc.
* Code spacing and organization - be consistent!
* UI looks so clean! Can you take it a step further and provide more clarity for user on what clicking a word means?
* AWESOME JOB!

## C: Group Work & Projects

## Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wheresmytyphone/TG-TH-gametime)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

 * Partner: Tyler Garner
 * Made a Flappy Bird clone using HTML canvas. We had to add missing features after the due date.
 
 * Eval with: Limbo
 
### Scores:
 #### Functional Expectations
 
 * 3 - Application is fully playable without crashes or bugs
 
 #### User Interface
 
 * 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
 
 ### Testing
 
 * 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of integration testing.
 
 #### JavaScript Style
 
 * 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
 
 #### Workflow
 
 * 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.
 
 #### Code Sanitation
 
 The output from eslint shows…
 
 * 3 - Five or fewer complaints

## Weathrly

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kalikoze/weatherly)
* [Original Project](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weathrly.html)

* Partner: Travis Rollins
* Used React to build an app that allows user to enter a city or zip code and then retrieves the current weather for that location using the Weather Underground API, as well as a 7 hour forecast and 10 day forecast.

* Eval with: Limbo
### Scores:

#### Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by React/JS. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

#### User Interface

3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality. The application less than 3 aXe-core violations

#### HTML Style

4 - Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

#### CSS/Sass Style

3.5 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

#### JavaScript / React Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing. Application has at least 6 components built out.

#### Testing

4 - Project has a running test suite that exercises the application at multiple levels (feature and unit). The test suite covers almost all aspects of the application.

#### Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

#### Code Sanitation

The output from a code sanitizer ESLint shows…

4 - Zero complaints

## D: Professional Skills

## Gear Up

### Empathy
 * [Session markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/empathy.markdown)

I think it's really important to try to see situations from other people's perspectives. There are lots of things about my life that I take for granted, and talking through the list of experience statements helped me realize that even simple things like having a quiet place to study and speaking the same language as the people around me are privileges that many people do not experience. This session reminded me that I should always make an effort to understand where other people are coming from.

### Being an Ally
 * [Session markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)

This gear up really drove home the idea that passively supporting things like gender equality and LGBT rights is usually not good enough. There are actual, concrete ways to act out your allyship in many situations. The scenarios we talked through were good examples of real-world opportunities to be an ally, and I think that this session definitely made me more motivated to stay attentive to these opportunites. I want to carry this mindset with me into my future jobs.

### Attention Economy
 * [Session markdown](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1706-inning/group_two.md)

This was a really fun gear up. The video we watched demonstrated how carefully social media companies design their apps so as to maximize the amount of time that people spend with them, and it made me think about how I as a developer could create a viable product while avoiding these exploitative practices. The amount of psychological research that companies like Facebook do keep people addicted to their service is a little terrifying, and I think ultimately it has a negative effect on users. I left this gear up with a much more negative view of social networking platforms than I came in with.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I think our cohort grew a lot closer this module. I really enjoyed working with my classmates on Complete Me and Sorting Suite, and I think the collaboration really helped everyone understand the concepts better. Pairing with mod 1 was really fun and fulfilling, and it was awesome to watch how fast they picked everything up. The fact that I felt comfortable answering their coding questions also made me realize how much I had learned in only a few months, which was pretty satisfying to think about. I also washed even more dishes than I did last mod.
