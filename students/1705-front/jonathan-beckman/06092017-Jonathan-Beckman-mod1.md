# (Jonathan Beckman) - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I dind't really have many pointed expectations for this mod.  Low expectations, no disapointment right?  Not really.  I obviously expected to learn something and I think I walked away knowing far more than I could have anticipated.  I guess I expected to walk away knowing how to effeciently and accurately use html and css.  The static comps helped a lot there, especially static comp 3.  That was a beast.  With javascript, I knew very little coming in and feel like I've learned so much there.  I can't realy say what my expectations were there because it was such a whirlwind but I feel like Im walking away with a small general working knowledge of javascript.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Proficient


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I did not anticipate as much group work as there was.  I get it now, that in the work place it will most always be a group effort working on a code base,

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1705/mod-1/number-guesser/jonathan.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)


##### Description
This project is a one player game where the user guesses a number within parameters that is has been randomly generated by the program. The user also has control over these parameters and can choose any number they like. Upon entering a number the program will check to be sure it is a playable number and enable the guess button. The clear button will also enable if the user wishes to clear the input field. Upon clicking the guess button the users number will be checked by the program and the user will be directed that the number was with too high, too low or the correct guess with the word ‘BOOM!’. If not the winning number, the user can then re-enter a new guess until the winning number is chosen. Upon choosing the winning game the word ‘BOOM!’ Will display, 3 seconds will pass and then new parameters will set, expanding the old parameters by 20 numbers. The game continues in this way until the user quits or clicks the reset button to restart the game.


##### Evaluation Note
Well done. Very tidy, good attention to details. Could use a refactoring pass, but overall a strong effort for the first project.


##### Score
Proficient

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Linked-List, IdeaBox, 2DoBoxPivot


#### Linked-List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/Link_List)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)


##### Description
This project was to create a page that made a list of website bookmarks.  When the user types in a title for the bookmark and the url for the page and hits the 'enter' button, the bookmark will be made and added to the list on the right side along with the other bookmarks.  When on mobile the site will adjust its layout based on your screen width to accomodate the best usage of space available. 


##### Evaluation Note
through phase 4

Well done, uneven distribution of work indicated by commits on github but sounds like work was more evenly distributed than that.


##### Score
Exceptional You completed Phase Three and did something with Phase Four.


##### Feedback Received 
Jonathan is really easy to work with and a great guy on top of it.  Very hardworking.  If anything I would just say that doing more work on our DTR would have been useful as he was a bit ahead of the class in his knowledge and ended up doing a good deal of the CSS work.

##### Evaluation Note
Search works
Qualities can be adjusted but dont persist
Edit works but on refresh gets quirky


##### Score
no score


##### Feedback Received 
I really appreciated your relaxed attitude. It helped me not stress or feel as bad when I wasn't able to contribute on the same level you were able to. It was also nice to get the chance to handle some of the early stages of building the project. I needed the practice and you trusting me to do that was great. I wish I had not freaked out and kept with the project despite my shortcomings. You pressed on with almost no hesitation and I respect that ability to push on. I wish we had gotten out ahead early and often on the project. Setting the tone early is crucial for someone like me and that we weren't able to establish our workflow early left me unsure how to proceed once we got going together on Monday. My previous pairing was one we got ahead early and it led to a less stressful project throughout and obv and  more enjoyable team experience. I'd suggest that you could try consider the needs and shortcomings a partner may have early on so as to better accommodate their needs while also making your needs known early in a way that they too can adjust for them.

#### 2DoBox-Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbexx/2DoBox-Pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)


##### Description
This webpage is designed for the user to store and edit ideas. They are stored with a title of the idea and with the body or description of the idea. The quality of the the idea can then be modified to display if it's a good idea(plausible), a shit idea(swill) or an excellent idea(genius). The user can add as many ideas as they can. And when they want to come back to an idea, the webpage stores their ideas.


##### Evaluation Note
Good job! Very nicely done, great team work, really captured the spirit of refactoring a codebase.


##### Score
Exceptional | Application meets all of the expectations of both phases and one or more of the extensions.


##### Feedback Received 
Hey Jonathan, I really enjoyed working on this project with you. I loved that we worked on just about everything together, and talking all of the problems through with you was really helpful for me in understanding the material. I appreciate your understanding of concepts and your ability to explain things with clarity. There was one evening where you worked on some small things without me that we didn't discuss beforehand, and in the future I would just like to agree to split the work up. However, you still walked me through what you had worked on and I don't feel like I missed out on anything. Thanks for the great experience and for all of the help, I hope that we get to work together again!

## D: Professional Skills
I appreciate that we have these gear ups to work on and advance our professional skills.  In the moment it can be tough to appreciate because there are so many things going on with projects, but I feel like this is one way that Turing shows that they do care for their students success.

### Gear Ups


#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_1_growth_mindset.markdown)

A growth mindset starts with belief, believing in something that is not yet apparent.  If you don't believe you can do something then you probably won't be able to do it.  A growth mindset starts with first believing in yourself, and then with work and grit anything is possible.

#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_2_getting_better_at_difficult_things.md)

One thing that stood out to me was the idea of owning up to your mistakes.  It builds trust with your team and/or boss when you can look them in the face and tell them you screwed up, and more often than not, there will be grace. I also think pair programming with others that are better than you is a substantially better way to learn. Wisdom and experience are not things that come easy, and someday you'll be the one on being asked to help out someone that may not know as much as you, and even then there is still a ton to learn from giving back.

#### Working with Introverts, Extroverts, and Ambiverts

* [GitHub URL]()

I'm sort of in the middle with a solid lean towards introversion.  I like to be social in certain aspects but I do need my time alone to recharge and process and think through things from the day or experience.  It was very helpful to learn about how the other side might perceive me and vice-versa.  I can better judge how others might be processing and handeling things and Im glad to be more aware of others perceptions of me when Im doing the same thing so that I can better explain myself or simply be more aware of the attitude I might be portraying.

#### Strengths and Storytelling

* [GitHub URL]()

I enjoyed this session.  I think its a powerful thing to know your own story and who you are in the midst of wherever you find yourself.  I think in sharing your story with others you'll find that things that you thought you were alone in, you actually share with other people.  Volnurability breeds volnurability, and being known by others is a life-giving thing.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL]()

This documentary was pretty eye opening.  I haven't worked in the corprate world before so I don't have any personal experience working with wemen in a corprate workplace, so watching this help me gain a better understanding of how wemen struggle.  The story of the women at github is very surprising to me.  I guess I think of tech companies as being forward thinking and progressive in how they opereate, but to find out that this situation was all but swept under the rug and those men just told her to stop being such a girl is quite shocking.


## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

This mod I feel like I've just got my feet under me with how things work.  I hope to contribute more in the mods coming up.  The ways I can think that I contributed so far was maybe simply answering questions that classmates had and help run through places where they may have been stuck and needed someone to listen and talk through it with them.
