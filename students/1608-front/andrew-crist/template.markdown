## B: Individual Work & Projects

My individual projects for Module 1 include a first draft of my Personal Portfolio and Color Changer.

#### Personal Portfolio

My personal portfolio needs a lot of work. I have the basic wireframing all set up, but need to build out the content of the website. My goals over break are: 1) begin a blog 2) clean up and connect all my social media accounts 3) take a handful of pictures to use on Twitter and portfolio.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The group projects I worked on during Module 1 include: Number Guesser, Linked List, IdeaBox, and Game-time.

#### Number Guesser

* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vN6D03pUAZe7IQpbOAAIS1-bxrF1UdCxMe_JAjoD6Lw/edit?usp=sharing](DTR)

Description:

Number Guesser was our first project. It utilized HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript and introduced us to the concept of DOM manipulation. The game generated a random number and after receiving user feedback, instructed the user to make another guesser that was higher or lower than their original guess.

Scores and Comments:

(3.5): Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Two

updated score to 3.5. # Fundamental JavaScript Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Notes: Extension till Friday to finish phase three for a 4 on Functional Expectations. Great job on pulling out and reusing code. Some room for refactoring and making methods more dynamic.

Feedback from Chaz:

Working with Señor Crist was a great introduction to peer-pairing, and completing an assignment as a group. `Number Guesser` was our Mods first group project and a great way to learn about collaborative work. Andrew and I managed to put together a great finished product as well as gain understanding about new methods such as `git`+`github` and grasping new languages i.e JS. Overall Andrew was, and will continue to be a great cohort mate for anyone to work with moving forward. His willingness to explain the nuances of code, and work at a pace that benefits others is extremely valuable, and speaks to his overall professionalism and character.

#### Linked List

* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RAoVmXbmUdNpPeoeYBsr2lpsCVYx5AhV0tGWpoxZhxU/edit?usp=sharing](DTR)

Description:

The Linked List project introduced us to using jQuery for DOM manipulation. Users should have been able to create bookmarks, mark them as read/unread, then be able to delete all read bookmarks.

Scores and Comments:

Functional Expectations

4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.
HTML Style

3: Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.
CSS Style

3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.
Fundamental JavaScript Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
Workflow

4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Feedback from Mike:

Working with Andrew on the Linked-List project was a very good experience. The first few weeks of the module I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with the content we were learning and Andrew was very helpful in explaining fuzzy concepts to me as we worked through them on the projects. Andrew was great at communication and really explaining his vision for the project, and was also open to suggestions and seeing things in different perspectives. 10/10 would work with him again.


#### IdeaBox

* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JGaJdmsR-fYMwvI61vQjEKbboaNqcIZBNAuP505G3kE/edit?usp=sharing](DTR)

Description: IdeaBox utilized everything we had learned and executed on previous projects with the addition of using JSON and saving to local storage. Users should have been able to create a title/body, submit them so they render on the page, be able to change the value of each idea and be able to refresh the page with all ideas being re-rendered to the page.

Scores and Comments:

Specification Adherence

3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface

4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

JavaScript Style

3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow

4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

Feedback from Ryan:

What can I say? Andrew is da’ bomb. Ideabox was definitely the hardest project we had so far.  We set clear expectations in the DTR and he completely fulfilled them. We had to work the entire weekend, and he was willing to do it. In the midst of a 10 hour bug, he didn’t stress and worked through it well with me. I was impressed with his persistence and desire to see the code through the finish line. I fully believe he will be a great developer with the potential to add value far beyond lines of code. Whatever company chooses to hire him at the end of the program will be blessed to have him. I would gladly work with him again.

Code Sanitation
The output from JSHint shows… 4 - Zero complaints#


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Chaz Gormley - Number Guesser

It was a pleasure to work with Chaz on Number Guesser. This was our first project as students at Turing and the project presented a lot of challenges. Neither of us knew where to start when it came to putting code ‘on the page’, how to communicate effectively while coding, or how to code in pairs. As amateurs, we entered the project with a lot of hiccups, but Chaz persevered, stepped up to the challenge, and pushed hard through all the barriers we faced. Chaz is an adaptable leader who will be successful with any project he faces.

Mike Ziccardi - Linked List

Working with Mike on Linked List was a joy. His sense of humor (oddly similar to mine) provided comic relief during the many troughs of this project. Mike has an eye for syntax which indubitably prevented stressful bugs we would have faced down the road. This was the first project that really forced us deeper into jQuery and using github for versioning. Mike plunged head first into wanting to figure out github instead of using hacks to version our code. Additionally, Mike sacrificed a lot of private events to complete our project. His selfless dedication is an example I want to personally live out.

Ryan Westlake - IdeaBox

IdeaBox was a challenge exponentially more difficult compared to our previous projects - Ryan wasn’t daunted. He is packed with a drive toward success, a drive that is contagious and provides a healthy energy that fueled us through the problems we encountered. He has a quick mind for catching syntax errors, absorbing problems, and can effortlessly verbalize possible solutions to a problem. It’s easily apparent that Ryan’s education extends further than the classroom as a handful of solutions he provided included concepts not mentioned during instruction. Ryan sets the bar for a passion to learn how to code.

### Being a Community Member



### Playing a Part

A large part of why I came to Turing was because of the community. I have been very impressed by the community established by Turing as well as by the community that was generated by my peers. I enjoyed engaging in discussions that were relevant to my peers, but not necessarily directly relevant to me - which I would argue are relevant to me now because they're relevant to the community in which I am a part. I've worked to encourage and assist the other students in my module and look forward to providing the same type of guidance that 1606 provided to me this module.
