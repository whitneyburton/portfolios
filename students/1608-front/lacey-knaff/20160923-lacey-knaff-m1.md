# Lacey Knaff - M1 Portfolio

## Summary

Before starting Turing I didn't really know what to expect. I come from a design background and chose to attend the program because I was interested in bridging the design/developer communication gap and be able to start a design and development business. I had some previous experience with HTML and CSS through tinkering around on websites I've designed and with in my previous job. I really didn't realize how little I knew until we surpassed everything I had taught myself in several years on my own a matter of 2 days at Turing. It really opened my eyes to how much effort this would take and that it would not come easy without going 100% all in. I'm generally used to learning concepts quickly and excelling in a school setting, so this module has really been about getting used to a new way of learning and getting back into the swing of learning in general.

I have a very long way to go, but I am very excited to learn as much as I can about front end development and how I can connect that to design and entrepreneurship while in this program.

## A: End of Module Assessment

**Assessed by:** Brenna Martenson

**Result:**

#### Feedback

Zero hesitation breaking out functions into small pieces and with slight guidance quickly rearranged where functions were being called. Would like to hear more vocalization about where she was going next in her code, but with psuedocode was very well organized and had a good grasp on what code she wanted to write and why. Really really strong eval!

#### Scores

* Progression/Completion: 3
* JavaScript: 3.5
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In Mod1 our individual projects included Color Changer and our Personal Portfolios. Since Color Changer was not a graded assignment I have only listed my personal portfolio below.

#### (Portfolio)

* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)
* [Published Project](https://lrknaff.github.io/01_PORTFOLIO/)

#####Description

Our personal portfolios are an ongoing project that are meant to represent our personal brand as a developer. The site should be easy to navigate, clearly organized, well written and free of Bootstrap or other style guides.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

In Mod1 we had 4 group projects. In order from first to last the projects we completed were: Linked List, Number Guesser, Idea Box, and Game Time.

#####Description

Assigned: 2016-9-12
Due: 2016-9-22

The goal of game time was to build a game that was playable in the browser and implement TDD. As a group, we decided to build a side scroller that was based on the Chrome dinosaur game. In our game you use the space bar to control Bluecifer (the DIA horse) and help him avoid airplanes and from hitting the ground. The further you get in the game the faster the planes go, making it harder to steer bluecifer to safety. You win the game by making it to a certain time on the score counter.

#####Feedback to me from Gabi Procell and Graham Nessler

It was a pleasure working with Lacey. Her knowledge of design is unparalleled, and she also had a lot of useful insights on JavaScript. The project hit some significant snags, but Lacey was always there with good insights to help us move forward. Nice job on a great game!

It was a pleasure working with Lacey on Game Time. Lacey has a great sense of design, and was a huge help with the awesome pixel art for our project. Lacey is very thoughtful in her approach to programming as well. I felt that she had an amazing grasp on the concept of OOP and how to implement it with our game. Things for Lacey to improve upon could be working more with TDD, and perhaps consulting pseudocode to drive development in the future. I also appreciated that during our project, Lacey took the time to listen, and discuss strategies with me when I was having trouble with our group workflow. Overall, Lacey is a super-sharp and snazzy developer that will go far! Thanks, Lacey!


#####Feedback from me from Gabi Procell and Graham Nessler

Working with Gabi on game time was great! She is concerned with the feelings of each person in the group and makes sure that every one is allowed time to play their part in the group. She is excellent with writing tests, and driven to accomplish anything she sets out to do. If she couldn't get a test to pass, or debug lines of code, she was asking for help within the Turing community and always had the best intentions for our group in mind by sharing her take aways in a clear and easy to understand way. Overall, she is a great team player and I really enjoyed working with her.

I really enjoyed working with Graham on game time. He's an insanely hard worker and often would work late into the night fixing bugs and implementing code and functionality that was above and beyond the expectations of the spec and our group. His workflow style is also one of the best things about working with Graham. He is a constant reinforcer of making frequent commits, something that I usually forget to do. Overall, I had a great experience working with Graham, and hope we get paired together again in the future!


#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lrknaff/ideaBox)

#####Description

Assigned: 2016-9-7
Due: 2016-9-12

Ideabox is an application that archives a list of ideas on the DOM and relies on localStorage to allow these ideas to persist on page refresh. As a team we built this responsive client-side application using javascript, jquery and JSON.

#####Evaluation Comments

* Very well done, good work!
* a couple small details in the comp were overlooked.
* really good job, in a very good place to start refactoring. Needs a little tidying up, but generally well done.


#####Evaluation Scores

* Spec Adherence: 3
* User Interface: 3.5
* JS: 2.75
* Workflow: 4

#####Feedback to me from Chelsea Skovgaard

Lacey is an excellent collaborator and partner. She brings a great sense of humor to pair projects, while also being determined and focused. There were times in our project where she would keep working on a problem for a long period of time determined to make it work even when it had been frustrating for hours. She also does a good job of communicating her needs to best work with a partner. After working on the project pair coding for some time and getting 80% done with the project, we split up the other parts working on them individually but next to each other. We both expressed desire to work individually on problems in addition to doing pair to pair programming. Working individually but asking each other questions was a great teamwork experience while doing individual work. Her collaborative abilities and true grit are great qualities that make her a great contributor and developer.

#####Feedback from me to Chelsea Skovgaard

I had an awesome time working with Chelsea for idea box! We meshed really well as partners, and I feel like solving and tackling problems, which is a somewhat daunting task, was made fun. She has a way of making you feel appreciated for your contribution to the team and celebrates in small successes. She has a knack for learning skills quickly which was incredibly helpful when it came to writing code, as she could take complex ideas that we just learned hours earlier and implement them into the project. Overall, I had a great time working with Chelsea and am excited to see her progress at Turing. She’s going to be a very skilled developer!

#### (Linked List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lrknaff/linked-lists)

Linked List was a group project that implemented jQuery to take the value from 2 input fields and rendered them on the DOM. In short, it was a small, responsive client-side bookmark application.

#####Evaluation Scores

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Fundamental JavaScript style: 3
* Workflow: 2
* HTML style: 3
* CSS: 2

#####Feedback to me from Nick Chambers

Lacey and I worked together on the Linked Lists project. I had a very positive experience collaborating with her and was super impressed by her code researching skills, creative problem solving, and CSS style wizardry. In addition to having an extremely keen eye for design, Lacey seemed to always be able to dig up some solution to our problems with her Google searches. She's a clear communicator, a highly engaged collaborator, and I think she's going to be a kick-ass developer.

#####Feedback from me to Nick Chambers

I had an awesome time working with Nick on Linked List. He's a great team player and has an infectious positive attitude, even in times of stress. He consistently does pulse checks in the group to re-DTR and make sure every one is feeling good about workflow and process. He's is an adept developer that brought a lot of skills to the team and is a confident problem solver. Hoping we can work together again in future projects!

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lrknaff/number-guesser)

#####Description

Assigned: 2016-8-22
Due: 2016-8-25

Number Guesser is a basic javascript game that takes a min and max value of two numbers that a user inputs and allows the user to guess the random number in between. If the user is correct the min and max values expand and the user now has to guess the number between the updated values.

#####Evaluation Scores

* UI/UX Expectations: 3
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Fundamental JavaScript style: 3

#####Feedback to me from Devin Beliveau

Lacey and I were a part of a three-person team for our first project and we all worked well together and had great communication throughout the project. Our schedules happened to work well with each other and we were usually always available at the same time. I really appreciated Lacey's willingness to stay after class so we could work together in person. For a first project, working together in person was so helpful. We each contributed to the project in our own ways and worked together to problem solve when we got stuck. Overall it was a great first project and I enjoyed working with Lacey very much.

#####Feedback from me to Devin Beliveau

I had a really great time working with Devin on our Number Guesser project. She is very good at picking apart larger problems and coming up with, and communicating, ways to solve them. She is very respectful of every one in the group and listens fully to ideas before responding, always providing great feedback while searching for a way to work together to tackle a problem.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

###Giving Feedback
Matt is an incredibly bright person, but his humble nature is really what makes him stand out in our community. He is always willing to drop whatever he is doing to help others, and truly wants to see every one in the program succeed. He also has a genuinely positive attitude which is evident in our group retros and in his conversations with others. Overall, Matt adds a great dynamic to our community and I’m excited to see him continue to grow in this program!

Maia acts as a shining light in the community. She always has a positive attitude and speaks up in classes to ask the questions that every one is thinking. She is great at being involved in discussions both academically and in the community. She is also great at providing a listening ear and offering advice in times of need. I’m very excited to have her in my cohort and am excited to see her grow at Turing!

###Being a Community Member
Lacey is awesome. As a graphic designer, she knows how to make things look really damn good - and she's always giving others suggestions for design tools to use. She is great to have real, meaningful and positive conversations with, and overall a pleasure to be around. I wish I had gotten to work on a project with Lacey this module. She has a good knowledge of the class material and shows real dedication to the program. I'm looking forward to working with Lacey more and hopefully picking up some of her design chops.



### Playing a Part

* I attended morning coffee with the Joane Clarke Society on Tuesdays and intend on continuing to attend when I can. I enjoy getting to know ladies from other modules and feeling like I have a support group of women.
* Was part of the Bezos posse and participated and contributed my opinions in group discussions.
* Attended Friday morning talks, Friday gear ups and lunch roulettes. I really enjoyed all of our gear up events and liked being involved in our break out discussions.
* I've expressed interest in being involved in GDI and hope to attend and help out with their events in the future.
* I've been active in group discussions and retros

###Goals

For mod2
* Volunteer at as many Girl Develop It events as time allows
* Possibly see what interest I can generate in a design/UX focused posse or group
* Work on using keyboard shortcuts
* Continue to focus on building a solid base in JS
* Focus on learning coding vocabulary so I can better communicate my thoughts to others
* Get involved in a meetup group that focuses on entrepreneurship and development or design and development
* Continue working on my portfolio and personal brand
