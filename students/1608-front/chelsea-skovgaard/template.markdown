# Chelsea Skovgaard - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to gain a foundational knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I think I accomplished through the projects. I also had the goal of better understanding the tech industry and possible career avenues, which I think I started through participating in a posse, going the a meetup, and talking to two mentors. Lastly, I wanted to feel comfortable using developers tools which I definitely feel I am on the way to achieving as I continue to feel comfortable with using atom, github, and terminal.

### Projects

I completed on four pair projects this module: game time, ideabox, linked list, and number guesser.

#### Game Time

* https://chelseaskovgaard.github.io/game-time/
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html

Breakout Game that is Broncos themed. The game allows the user to select a level, see their score, and know when they have won or lose.

good test setup. Would like to see that come together
test set up great scenario but could improve with understanding how a function changes an objects value.
OO logic is looking good. would like to see that solidified More #

From Chaz:
Weeks 5 & 6 of Module 1 were the most trying, as well as the most rewarding. Much of the reward comes from the work that Chelsea and I completed during our time collaborating on the `Game Time` project we undertook: `Broncos Breakout` aka `Brick Breaker`. Entering this stretch of the Mod my JS skills, and knowledge base are admittedly not where I want them to be, however working with Chelsea has greatly aided my growth in this area. Assigning tasks, and dividing a project into sections, in order to complete the necessary components of it - was a method we began to perfect as time progressed. A key component of collaborative work is communication, and our work together helped to solidify and further develop these skills. Overall, our time together was vital in terms of both growth of skill-set and personal development.

#### IdeaBox

* https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/ideaBox
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html

Application that utilizes local storage to save ideas with information. User can save the idea title, body, and quality. These fields are also editable.

Very well done, good work!
Note: really good job, a couple small details in the comp were overlooked.
Really good job, in a very good place to start refactoring. Needs a little tidying up, but generally well done.

Specification Adherence: 3
User Interface: 3.5
JavaScript Style: 2.75
Workflow:4

From Lacey:
I had an awesome time working with Chelsea for idea box! We meshed really well as partners, and I feel like solving and tackling problems, which is a somewhat daunting task, was made fun. She has a way of making you feel appreciated for your contribution to the team and celebrates in small successes. She has a knack for learning skills quickly which was incredibly helpful when it came to writing code, as she could take complex ideas that we just learned hours earlier and implement them into the project. Overall, I had a great time working with Chelsea and am excited to see her progress at Turing. She’s going to be a very skilled developer!

#### Linked List

* https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/linked-lists
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html

Application that has input fields for title of bookmark and URL of bookmark. Bookmark can be added to the page and displays title, URL, and buttons to "Mark as Read" and "Remove" the bookmark.

Super clear that both parties touched all parts of the code. Design decisions were all very intentional and devs can speak to why they chose to make css decisions they did.

From Ryan:
Working with Chelsea was a great experience. I was honestly not sure how we would work together, but we ended up complementing each other. There were a couple points where I was moving too fast, she simply recommended a different approach and things started to go better. She seems to have a good grip on JS and CSS. She also likes Smashburger milkshakes, which is cool, cause I’m a big fan.

#### Number Guesser

* https://github.com/ChelseaSkovgaard/number-guesser
* http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html

Build a game where the user picks a number between 1 and 100

Functional Expectations: 3

From Maia:
Chelsea and I tackled our first project head on!  We had some bumps in the road, but I'm actually glad that we dealt with them in the first project.  We did a great job working though the challenges and stopping to reset our process when we needed.  It really helped us appreciate the value of laying out the goals and expectations for the project and the workflow from the beginning.  Chelsea is bright and able to think through the problem in a logical manner.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Lacey:
Lacey is an excellent collaborator and partner. She brings a great sense of humor to pair projects, while also being determined and focused. There were times in our project where she would keep working on a problem for a long period of time determined to make it work even when it had been frustrating for hours. She also does a good job of communicating her needs to best work with a partner. After working on the project pair coding for some time and getting 80% done with the project, we split up the other parts working on them individually but next to each other. We both expressed desire to work individually on problems in addition to doing pair to pair programming. Working individually but asking each other questions was a great teamwork experience while doing individual work. Her collaborative abilities and true grit are great qualities that make her a great contributor and developer.

To Jeff:
Jeff is generous with his time and assistance. I had several pairing sessions with him and he was always willing to answer questions about projects. He is a huge asset to the community. When doing a pairing session or asking Jeff a question, he was great at helping me come to the answer or try things on my own while still guiding or assisting in finding a method that worked. He maintains a great balance of guiding but also not giving the answer so that you learn.

To Ryan:
Working on linked list with Ryan was a good experience, I think he does a good job of thinking through a problem and searching for solutions through google and resources. He works on a problem for a while and then reaches out for help when needed. He was also open to switching driving the program, which was helpful for my learning style.

To Chaz:
Chaz and I worked on game time together. Initially, there were some rocky patches but after discussing our needs and expectations mid-way through the project, we got on the same page and there was smooth sailing. Chaz’s strengths are empathy and positivity - he is great at supporting people and remaining calm even during stressful situations. By being assertive in his learning and taking ownership of parts of projects, his skills as a developer will continue to grow. I was also impressed by his dedication to his learning during our project often staying late into the night and taking advantage of pairing sessions.

To Hilary:
Although I did not work on a project with Hilary directly, she is always open to discussions about how to work through complex problems. She can explain the code she wrote in a way that helps you understand the ideas behind it and not just the syntax. She also is a positive and helpful presence in our cohort. I also appreciate her representation on SAB - she is great at getting and sharing feedback. Looking forward to working with her on a project. We have a great idea for a pomodoro app :wink:

To Maia:
Working on number guesser was challenging since it was the first project and it was hard to know what to expect or how to approach it. Maia did a good job of communicating her boundaries and expectation and in doing so helped me figure out how to better express my own boundaries and expectations in projects moving forward. The experience of working on the project also helped me understand how important reaching out for help was moving forward in other projects. Although we both put the effort in, I think since we were both new there were frustrations that could have been remedied if we had reached out for help. Maia is an exceptionally hard worker and definitely puts in the effort and time to learn material.

To Gabi:
Gabi is a wonderful asset to the cohort. Her willingness to answer questions about Turing is so helpful and appreciated. Gabi is also filled with cheerfulness and exudes a calm demeanor. Even when people are frustrated or stress, she remains positive and supportive. I have enjoyed working with Gabi on small exercises like making the design persona and look forward to working with her on a future project.


### Being a Community Member
From Hilary:
Even though I was not paired to work with Chelsea on a project yet, we collaborated a lot throughout the module. Chelsea is able to break down complex concepts so I can understand it in a logical way. Her eye for design and talent with CSS is something I will be looking to Chelsea for help in future modules. I look forward to being paired with Chelsea in future projects because I know we will work very well together and her sense of humor brings happiness to me every day.

### Playing a Part

I supported the larger Turing community in a number of ways during this module. I was active in attending lunch roulette and gear ups to interact with students from across modules. I also was active in the Pahlka posse - contributing to meetings and projects. Lastly, I was most excited/proud of participating on a turing team for hack.thenews - it was a great way to use what I've learned, work with other students(all other participants were backend) and raise awareness for Turing (we mentioned Turing during our presentation and were tweeted about). Also, Jasmine and I will be working on a Turing blog post during intermission week about the experience.
