## A: End of Module Assessment

TBD....................

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The following are individual projects during the mod. 

#### (Personal Project - FareHarbor Toolkit)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/fare-harbor-toolkit)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

For my personal project, I had the opportunity to work with FareHarbor, a company based in Denver. They build software for the online tour booking industry. They already have a backend built out, which is their money-maker, but they needed a better way to embed new tools. 

I helped build the platform to embed new tools and improved ways for users to walk through the booking process. From the beginning, building for scale and flexibility was key. I used the Module pattern to structure my code and ended up building something that will work nicely.

From Graham:

Though Ryan and I had already worked together on a project this module, we found ourselves effectively paired up on the FareHarbor personal project, and this deserves a second note. Ryan was a great partner for this project. He was always prepared and contributed a lot of really good insights throughout. He's got a great attitude and I know that he's going places. Kudos to a great partner! 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

These are group projects throughout the mod. 

### (Weathrly)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/weather-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

This was a weather app built using React, Redux, and React Router. It makes use of the Create React App package.

####Evaluation scores
Specification Adherence

4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.
Redux Architecture

3 - At least one component is not connected with Redux appropriately. Application state is mutated by more than just Redux. The Redux store is missing application data that it should be handling.
Routing

4 - Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.
JavaScript Style

3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Testing

3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.
Workflow

3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.
Troubleshooting

4 - Most to all questions were posed to instructors with expected information

####Feedback to me

From Lacey: 


Ryan is a phenomenal addition to any team. I think he has a great grasp on React, React Router and Redux so I was really excited to get the opportunity to work with, and learn from him on our Weathrly project. I was really impressed with his willingness to not only slow down and explain concepts, but his humbleness to ask questions about things he didn't know and ability to take feedback and ideas. I agree with his critique, for both of us, to not get flustered over problems that don't get solved right away and to take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and begin to break things down into small feasible chunks.  Overall, he's a great team player and I would love to work with him again. 

From Nick: 

This was my second time working with Ryan, and it was another enjoyable experience deving apps here at the Turing School. I really have a good time working through problems with him, white-boarding, and the general partner-to-partner process of figuring out solutions. He brings a lot of enthusiasm and energy to his work, and it's a fun thing to be a part of. Ryan did a good job of letting loose a bit and enjoying himself this time around, while also being solid and accountable when it came to getting things done. Going into the project he mentioned that he was working on having more fun, and I think he did well in that effort. I'd continue to encourage him to work on his active listening and work to understand what all his partners are trying to say. He definitely does a fine job at leading the project effort and getting everyone involved, but sometimes I think he can get a little bit of tunnel vision when he's really trying to figure stuff out. Ryan's continuing to progress at a really rapid rate, and he's a great dude to work with. I'd absolutely love to work with him again.


### (remEMBER)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rcwestlake/ember-remember)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/remember.html)

This was our first exposure to Ember. We built a simple to-do app. It was built using agile principles, where each feature was reviewed, changed, and pushed into production before new features were started. It was a to-do app, and the focus was on Ember, not design and CSS, so it's not as pretty as I'd usually like.

####Evaluation scores
Based on number of iterations completed. We passed. 

####Feedback to me

From Hilary:

Learning Ember can be very frustrating but working with Ryan helped accelerate my learning curve. I enjoyed working with Ryan because he was able to pick up on concepts and solve problems very logically and quickly. Considering the unique circumstance that my computer was in the shop, I did not have the opportunity to touch the project as much as I would have liked at the beginning. I would have felt more comfortable if Ryan and I had switched off times using his computer more consistently so I did not feel like I wasn't contributing enough to the project. By the end of the project, Ryan solved this issue when he suggested that one person drives and the other person explains what the person driving should do. I would love to get the opportunity to work with Ryan again because I know we will be able to more efficiently communicate with each other by using this model.


## D: Professional Development
Professional development parts from the mod. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### ('Da Flower Exercise. Mine's a Rose.)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

I led a ironFE session on React Native and talked with several people in Mod 2 when they were considering it for their final project. 

### Being a Community Member

I volunteered to help with Try Turing.

### Playing a Part

Volunteered with Try Turing, participate in Fridays, attend Bezos possee talks. 

### Gear Up

####Microaggressions

This was a mixed one for me. I understood the purpose and how dangerous microagressions can be, but wouldn't arrive at the same conclusion as the Gear Up. For me, the challenge as humans, is not microagressions, which is a causality of a larger issue, and instead has much more to do with the fact that we ought to think of others better than ourselves. We ought to be kind. The danger of putting too much focus on microagressions is that it perpetuates a victim mentality, rather encouring folks to have the confidence to be who they are and focus on the difference they can make. 

####Journey mapping

This was a good lesson for a basic introduction into understanding user's needs and how it might work. 

####Grit

Good lesson. I need more grit in my life.
