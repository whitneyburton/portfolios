### Giving Feedback

Adam - It was great getting to work with Mike again on this project.  I know he sacrificed his idea for the project and we built something different and he was good about making sure this didn't bother him to much.  One area Mike could have improved on was making sure that he was explaining more about his code contributions, as he took on the part of really learning Vue and I felt like I did not fully understand it.  In the end though he helped a lot with the application and it was awesome that he got our native notifications to work as I know this took him some time to figure out.

Ben - I was really happy to get to work with Ben again. He was great at getting the ball rolling and taking charge of our API calls and reduxing. Our group could have communicated more clearly at times, as we we occasionally stepped on eachothers’ toes with the work we were doing, but other than that, Ben’s the man, I’m sure he’ll go on to do great things!

### Professional Development

Top 3 priorities in job search

  1. Find a job - this is the reason I came to turing!
  2. Flexible hours - I'd like to not have to sit in rush hour traffic.
  3. Showers - I'd like to run at lunch.

### Gear Up

 Micro Aggressions - I thought this one was interesting, there were people in my group that
  were micro-agressing that didn't realize it, and it was rather eye opening

 Journey Mapping - I thought this one was valuable because it was very similar user stories that
  we have leanred to assist us with testing

 Grits - I didn't agree with this session because I think that grit can be developed through
  effort, which was not necessarily what the session discussed.

### Being a Community Member

Adam - Adam was really fun to work with! He really pushed me to try new things that I was hesitant to try at first, such as Vue.js - and I’m really glad we went that route. As always he’s a champ at design and css. He could have maybe gotten his hands on the Vue more, but this was probably more my fault for not explaining things very well than his - sorry about that, Adam! Ultimately, I was really happy that he pushed me on this one, and very happy with how it turned out.
