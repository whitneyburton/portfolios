# Jeff Duke - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For this module I set out to learn all I could about building websites and the basics of programming in javaScript.  I learned far more than I ever expected.  The first couple of weeks were really eye opening.  Coming in to the program I had such a narrow scope of what could be done with the trifecta of HTML, CSS and js!  After listening to Steve's talks the first couple of days, as well as the talks from our guest speakers, I reinforced my own goal of giving my all to Turing, making sure to check my ego and to be ok getting outside my comfort zone.  I feel like this has really paid off for me.  I've learned that it's ok to feel totally stuck, a bit of imposter syndrome and way out of my comfort zone.  The longer I spend feeling like that, the better I become as a developer and the more my comfort zone grows.  

### End of Module Assessment

Progression/Completion

    3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
    Notes from Jhun: Could possibly be moving a little faster but Jeff is very methodical about his code and refactors as he goes.

JavaScript Style

    3+: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components


Workflow

    4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

Collaboration

    3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

Feedback to me:
_I wouldn't have wanted to be paired with anyone else for a project of this magnitude. Jeff is a super-strong coder, with the creativity to break through the hard problems, and the discipline to write tests and refactor code. Our DTR created a great working environment and we were able to comfortably check in at several points along the way. Even when we decided to divide-and-conquer, we were able to come back together and share our ideas, and the result was that we accomplished our shared goal of each understanding the entire code base. One opportunity for both Jeff and I is that we are both vulnerable to getting tunnel-visioned/obsessed by a code problem, and retreating into our own mental worlds. This worked great when we were paired together, because we could feel free to break apart, work, and reunite. However, this approach may not work as well if our future pairs require more constant interaction. But in the end this was a really positive experience, and I'm really proud of both our product and our collaboration._

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/idea-box)

* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eFecFKfEHieZ_2NJHo8P2i06KGhejAlKGsQOk6DFD6Y/edit?usp=sharing)

IdeaBox is a place to store ideas online and have them persist.  This project used a lot of jQuery and introduced the concepts of working with localStorage for a back-end.  [Readme](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/idea-box/blob/master/README.md)

Scores:
Spec Adherence: 4
User Interface: 4
JS: 3.5
Workflow: 4

Feedback to me:

_You were a fantastic partner! Our workflow together was smooth and consistent. You were on top of your commits with committing small changes, which helped me to commit more frequently. I think it was a smart idea to focus on the areas that were our weaknesses and that played out well for both of us strengthening our weaker points. Then it was beneficial refactoring and reviewing each other’s work. You were a great communicator when I didn’t understand some JS/jQuery methods and would methodically explain things to me in a manner that was easy to digest. Your skills with debugging helped me to understand how to use the ‘debugger’ effectively. All in all, it was a pleasure working with you, especially since we seemed to balance each other out_

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/mod-links)
* [GH Pages](https://jeff-duke.github.io/mod-links/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XQyM5hAbPXL6AnMrCW9X_oAqfr-VWJTX0e61VyMs3fA/edit?usp=sharing)

The linked list project introduced us to the concepts of DOM manipulation with jQuery.  The site is a place to add some bookmarks, mark them if they've been read and delete them.  The bookmarks do not persist on page reload.  [Readme](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/mod-links/blob/master/README.md)

CSS: 3

Feedback to me:

_Jeff, it was such a pleasure getting the opportunity to work with you on our project. Your strength as a coder was not the only thing that stood out to me when we were working together. I felt that your ability to synthesize the larger problems into actionable tasks helped us progress at a steady pace. You were extremely helpful, accommodating, and patient throughout the entire problem solving process. I felt we worked well together, balancing each other's strengths. The DTR exercise that we deliberately executed at the beginning of our project was extremely beneficial in explicitly defining and communicating our goals for growth. Your willingness to address your perceived areas for growth and attack problems head on was very refreshing and inspiring. Also, your calm, collected and systematic approach to project management and execution set the tone for how I continue to approach problem solving. I really enjoyed working with you and hope to do so again in the future.

Thank you._

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/number-guesser)
* [GH Pages](https://jeff-duke.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tqe8_ksqKDDdR5OqZHtoi7BhETUxV8unCJDUqCM7-b4/edit#heading=h.l3ct5pv2ggfg)


Number Guesser was our first big project.  It introduced us to writing HTML, CSS and Javascript on our own to solve a problem.  We used vanilla Javascript for DOM manipulation which gave us a greater appreciation for jQuery in later projects.  
[Readme](https://github.com/Jeff-Duke/number-guesser/blob/master/Readme.md)

Scores:
Functional: 4
JS Style: 3

Feedback to me:

_It was a pleasure working with Jeff on the number guesser project. Jeff clearly has a firm grasp on the material and was very strong in the javascript concepts even being the first time that we had worked with them. I really don’t have much critical feedback to give Jeff. I feel that he may have gone ahead a bit on his own for some of the final aspects of the project but at the time we had split up some of the work so it is to be expected. It was great working with him and I look forward to doing so in the future._

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Blake on Number Guesser:

_It was great working with Blake and I’m really glad we were partnered up for the first project.  We worked really well together and were able to map out and work through the problems together.  Blake also has some great design chops and really made our project stand out.  The only actionable feedback is that we were both eager to get code on the screen which didn’t work out as well as the times when we stopped and mapped out/pseudo-coded the problem we were trying to solve and what steps we needed to take to solve it.  Once we started doing that things went a lot smoother and I think we can both keep that in mind on future projects.   I look forward to working with Blake on other projects in future modules!_

Feedback to Madison on Linked-List:

_Super great working with you on our project.  I thought our workflow was really good and that we work really well together.  As we chatted about, I think something for you to keep in mind as we go forward is that you’re a better developer than you give yourself credit for!  There were definitely times when I saw that you had an idea ready to go but it felt like you held back and that you deferred to me.  Don’t be afraid to take the reins and work out an idea you have or at least bring it up to discuss it as an option!  Had a great time working with you and would gladly pair with you on future projects!_

Feedback to Kirsten on Idea Box:

_It was great working with you and I thought we worked really well together!  I think it was great that you wanted to take on the js/jquery for the project and strengthen your skills.  Keep looking for areas that you feel you need improvement on and forcing yourself to take those on.  Also I thought it was great that if there was a piece of code you didn’t understand you made sure that we paused and went over it until you fully understood it.  Don’t be afraid to pause or stop your partner so you can go over any code you don’t understand!  Keep doing what you’re doing_

Feedback to Casey on Game-Time:

_It was great working with Casey on this project and I feel really fortunate that I had him as a partner.  Casey is a very strong developer and super smart.  He got us out of many tough points with strong ideas and a good approach to problem solving.  The only actionable feedback I can give is on something I’m working on for myself.  We both had a tendency to just dive into the code on our own machines at times when we were really stuck, which probably took longer to find a solution than if we continued to bounce ideas off each other and work the problem together.  I think this is just something for us both to work on any time we’re in a pairing situation and we can continue to collaborate with other students.  I’m really pleased with how the project turned out overall and will really look forward to working with Casey in the future._


### Being a Community Member


### Playing a Part

 - I participated in the StrengthsFinder pilot program that Beth put on to see if it would be a good option for the Turing community at large.  
 - I participated in an episode of the Turing podcast which, at the time of this writing, has not been released.
 - I've tried to keep an eye out to see if someone is struggling or getting frustrated and see if I might be able to offer some assistance.  Often just lending someone a second set of eyes can spark an idea that leads to some forward progress.  

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3+ - I received two 3s, a 3+ and a 4, so borderline between 3/4

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4 - I have had strong evaluations for my projects and I love learning as much as I can about the projects and concepts were presented with.  I often jot down topics during class or a reading and then research them on my own to get multiple explanations/perspectives on an idea.  I also try to help debug others projects if/where I can as it helps me understand the concepts better.

* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 4 - I have had very strong evaluations on all my group projects and really good overall feedback from my partners.  I've used the DTR memo in all projects to help identify ares that I and my parter would like to improve and then make sure that we both focus on those areas.  One example was working with Kirsten on Idea Box.  I said that I was feeling weak on my CSS and she stated that she felt weak on her JavaScript.  Because of that she took point on the js and I took lead on the CSS.  We would then send our code to each other and review/refactor each other's code.  We made sure to take time to review these changes with each other so that when it came to the end of the project we were both much stronger developers, and we both fully understood the codebase for the whole project.

* **D: Community Participation**: 3 - I did participate in a few extras at Turing but did not get as involved as I would have liked.  I think this first module was more about learning to learn again and to see where I might have some free time.  I am planning to start a blog over the intermission to chronicle my experiences in the front end program and will be looking into doing some student-led sessions next module.  There has been a lot of interest from the back-end folks around learning more front end and there are a lot of opportunities for all of us to help out.

* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 4 - I have really tried to make sure to give good, positive and actionable feedback while working with pairs on projects.  This feedback has been mostly in person.  I made sure to get feedback to all partners for the portfolio writing but could have done a better job of getting that to them right after the project.  I'll look to to that on future projects.  I feel like I've done a good job of taking instructor and peer feedback to heart and finding ways to improve based on that feedback.

### Notes
Wanted to build cool websites, then realized all the cool things that could be done. Really is pushing to stay outside of his comfort zone, the longer your outside of it the larger it gets. Excited to build stuff!

Staff: you’re a great asset to this group. You’re positive, hardworking, and encouraging to everyone. We all think you’re wonderful, and we’re so happy you’re here. We’re excited to see you get more and more involved with the community!

### Outcome

PASS
