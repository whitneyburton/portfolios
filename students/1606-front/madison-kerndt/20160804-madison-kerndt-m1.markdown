### Areas of Emphasis

####Summary:
This module I embarked on a whole new journey to conquer my fears and attack an interest head on. Prior to Turing I was minorly technical. I was frustrated by my limitations and inabilities as it applied to website design and construction. I was afraid that computer programing would prove to be too difficult or even impossible if not   met with natural inclination. This module I set out to prove to myself that grasping computer programming concepts is not beyond my reach. I aim to kindle the burning interest to solve complex problems and soon meet the challenge with ability and expertise.

####Goals:
* Have career options that incorporate my own background in design and technology startups
* Familiarize myself with the vocabulary, systems, and tools efficient developers rely on
* Cultivate relationships with Denver Development community
* Create portfolio that stands out with all the necessary componentry that communicates who I am in a well rounded, professional manner
* Build virtual presence in the startup, venture capital, and technology communities

####My Driving Principles:
* Pursue external interest as it relates to coding, development and tech
* Familiarize myself with the community and available opportunities
* Strategically choose beneficial involvement channels
* Continue to push for improvement but accept current ability

This is the classic snake game written is pure JavaScript. Upon starting the game, the user has the ability to move the sake on the board, using the appropriate arrow keys. The tick function will move the snake around the board while continuing to check for collision with the food, wall, or other snake segments. If any of these criteria are met the end game state will be triggered. If the negative collisions are avoided and a positive is met, the snake will maintain a larger number of segments within itself. There is essentially no real way to win but the difficult of navigating the snake increases as the snake grows.

#####Feedback to me from Kirsten Swanson

We made the snake grow! What a fun roller coaster that project was with you. Whenever I was lost with the unshifting and popping of the snake you did a thorough job explaining it. Although at times you were moving so quickly that I couldn't understand your thinking sometimes. Your diagrams of the logic of the game were great references to help in constructing the game. Whenever we needed help you were resourceful and didn't hesitate to reach out. And when you needed assistance with CSS I'm glad you asked me for help. Thank you for working around my schedule with moving and for having the drive you did to complete the project after many late nights together. Overall, our work styles meshed great together and you were a wonderful partner!

####Description

This is a simple web application with two prominent buttons, the 'random' button and the 'reset' button. Each button functions to create a simple, fun, and interactive game for the users. The 'random' button will generate a HEX number and display on the page background (white is not included). The 'reset' button simply sets the background color to white.

#####Functionality

The 'random' button randomly generates a string of 6 numbers (0-9) and letters(A-F) assigned as a HEX value. This HEX value is then designated through the jQuery method '.css()' to display this color as the background of the entire user page. Each click of the random number button triggers the generation of a new HEX value.

The reset button will return the game to the default background-color of white. It is important to note, that the HEX value of the background-color will never be equal to #ffffff and therefore will never appear as white.

A user is able to toggle their button presses between to get their fill of the multitude of colors HEX can provides.

Number guesser is a simple application written in Vanilla Javascript that evaluates a guess(must be a valid number), against a randomly generated, winning, number. The functionality increases as the user 'levelsup'. Maximum and minimum input fields reveal themselves once a user wins their first game. The difficulty is also increase as the range of winning numbers widens by 20. Error messages and hints will guide the user through the game towards the winning number.

#####Evaluation Comments

* Need to work on game functionality, best way is to focus on one aspect at a time
* Work on function names to offer clarity

#####Evaluation Scores

* Functionality: 3
* JS Style: 2.5

#####Feedback to me from MaryJane Valade

As our second project together I felt that we worked really well as a team. We were much better at breaking the project up into tasks and Madison’s use of a Trello board was very helpful. Her grasp of JavaScript and making attempts at trouble-shooting when we ran into problems helped us when we got stuck. I think we got more comfortable asking for help sooner than on the last project but we were also able to ask better questions and be more directed in what exactly we needed help doing.

#####Description
(Used as ReadME)

########Intro

This is a simple weblink storage list site. You enter a title and a URL for your link, click the submit button, or press enter, and a bookmark card is created below. The bookmark can be marked as read, removed from the list, or all read bookmarks can be removed en masse. The tool authenticates the title and URL inputs to ensure the user input is functional. The populated cards can be referenced to remember your favorite links. A counter functionality tracks the total number of bookmarks along with those marked as read.

#######jquery Logic

On page load the Mod Links loads an interface that allows users to input a title and url of a website they wish to save. Upon typing in either input the submit button is enabled. Once the input fields are populated, and the submit button is clicked, a bookmark is generated with the read and remove buttons, the counters appear and the total bookmarks counter increments up.

The logic begins when the user enters text into the inputs fields. Triggered by the click on the Submit button, the input is validated. Both a title and valid URL must exist for any further logic to occur; if this is not the case a custom error message will appear. If all inputs are valid the article list is prepended. This new article is visible as a new bookmark card. Each bookmark card contains a clickable title along with a read and remove button. The read button will add a class to the article element, if clicked again the class will toggle and therefore be removed. The remove button will remove the entire article. If 1 or more articles are marked as read, the 'Clear all Read' button will be enabled and if clicked, will clear all bookmark cards with the read class. The number counter keeps track of the number of elements with the 'mod-link' class and the read class to notify the user on the current state of their bookmark library. A user can continue to save bookmarks and keep track of saved bookmarks in this manner until the browser is refreshed.

#####Feedback to me from Jeff Duke

Super great working with you on our project.  I thought our workflow was really good and that we work really well together.  As we chatted about, I think something for you to keep in mind as we go forward is that you’re a better developer than you give yourself credit for!  There were definitely times when I saw that you had an idea ready to go but it felt like you held back and that you deferred to me.  Don’t be afraid to take the reins and work out an idea you have or at least bring it up to discuss it as an option!  Had a great time working with you and would gladly pair with you on future projects!

Idea box is an application that saves the most valuable asset humans have, their ideas. This project uses Javascript to dynamically generate articles that are rendered on your page. The ideas are automatically saved to local storage and are accessible for the future use. The idea quality and content can be edited and modified, these changes will also be saved. Search is also a key functionality of the this application, allowing users to quickly find ideas from keywords in either the body or title of the desired idea.

### Giving Feedback

#####Feedback to MaryJane Valade (Number Guesser Partner) (Idea Box Partner)

MaryJane it was such a great experience getting the opportunity to grow with you. I felt that our progression between the two projects exemplified our learning throughout Turing. We started out with a somewhat rocky as we both absorbed the abundance of information presented to us in the initial weeks at Turing. We pulled through our first project and continued to improve thereafter. I am thankful that I got to experience your growth in project management, development and confidence. I am not only admirable of your CSS skills but also your persistence to understand complex topics. I hope that you continue to cultivate your confidence in coding and leadership through future projects. I felt that we balanced each other well and helped to strengthen the skills of one another brought to the table.

#####Feedback to Jeff Duke (Linked List Partner)

Jeff, it was such a pleasure getting the opportunity to work with you on our project. Your strength as a coder was not the only thing that stood out to me when we were working together. I felt that your ability to synthesize the larger problems into actionable tasks helped us progress at a steady pace. You were extremely helpful, accommodating, and patient throughout the entire problem solving process. I felt we worked well together, balancing each other's strengths. The DTR exercise that we deliberately executed at the beginning of our project was extremely beneficial in explicitly defining and communicating our goals for growth. Your willingness to address your perceived areas for growth and attack problems head on was very refreshing and inspiring. Also, your calm, collected and systematic approach to project management and execution set the tone for how I continue to approach problem solving. I really enjoyed working with you and hope to do so again in the future.
Thank you.

#####Feedback to Kirsten Swanson (Game Time Partner)

Kirsten, I really enjoyed working with you on this project. I felt that our constant collaboration was very beneficial to the outcome of the game. You are very strong in your attention to detail and thoughtfulness about a methodology and functionality of the game. I think you did a great job deliberately taking a piece of the project and pushing forward to completion. Constructively I think that that it would be beneficial to test your hypotheses quicker vs over thinking them. I really valued our time working together and the level of camaraderie we had during the process.

### Notes
Started feeling not terribly technical, has become a strong member of this cohort.

Needs to work on focusing on building smaller pieces of functionality. You can get too focused on the big picture and lose site of the small steps that you have to take to get there.

Future goals: get involved with Kids Who Code work with Kumbo

Goals for mod2: public speaking, more community involvement

### Outcome

PASS
