Bao Nguyen - M2 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis

Emphasis on working with Rails / backend web development conventions.
We started with writing a sinatra app. This was helpful in helping us to build the MVC from scratch.
After transitioning to Rails, an emphasis on repitition of skills was made.

D: Professional Development

PD1: Cold Outreach 1
 - I did not do a cold outreach this module. Instead I attended two Boulder Ruby meetups and I am planning on going to more. I hope to build a relationship with the people that I meet there.

Feedback II:
What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator?

I think I am working well as a pair programmer but I also find strength in collaborating and working on the projects individually. The two group projects that we have done in module 2 have allowed for lots of opportunity for individuals to program, and also allow for the space for someone to ask to pair on a problem.

How do you use your strengths as a team member?

I like to use my strengths to break down a problem and make it easier to start on. Analyze the project specs, then come up with how to do it in iterations and also how to break the project into pieces. This allows everyone to work on parts individually.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths?

I would like to continue to improve project management and collaboration skills.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate?

I would like to continue to ask team members about their concerns and input.

How would you like your teammates to see you?

I would like my teammates to see me as the person they would absolutely want to work with.

Feedback III:
Date of feedback conversation: Wednesday May 10th, 2017

How did you prepare for the conversation?

I prepared for the conversation by thinking about what to say to my group partners and how to say it. I think about the body language involved and I visualize how the conversation will go.

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

The conversation went well. We talked about how the last few days went with the project. We also discussed pairing more and working together in the beginning to help with solving a few conceptual problems.

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

I used the coaching and appreciation principles.

Agile Work Practices:

Both projects that I participated in, were very agile this past module. This became more agile in the second project which I found to be awesome. We were very efficent, with the little shop project nearly done on Monday (on a three person team!). We planned for a tiny bit every day, about 15 minutes to figure out what everyone was working on and what they had accomplished. Then we used the waffle board to organize tasks and make sure no tasks were repeated. Lastly, this organization helped us avoid merge conflicts, so our git workflow was nearly pristine.

Feedback from partner projects.

Project 1 (): Bike Share
Overall, the feedback was everyone felt that they didn't understand the project and what was going on for the first four days.
We broke off and each worked on code individually, and we paired for some of the harder problems in the end. This created
some frustration among team members because no one knew how every piece of the project worked. That said, I think it was
a great group to work with and we did work really well together.

Project 2 (Alex): Little Shop
Feedback from Alex: Nothing to say.
Feedback for Alex: Working with Alex is great. I think he is definitely a competant developer.
I only brought up that on both days on the weekends, he was late to meeting up for an 11am start by 15-30 min each day.
This did not bother Nick or myself, but I thought it was important that Alex know that it may not be acceptable to others.

Project 2 (Nick): Little Shop
Feedback from Nick: Keep doing what I am doing.
Feedback for Nick: Great project management. The critical paths planning and the workflow went well and made
for a very smooth project.

E: Community

Gear Up

Mindful Communication

This gear up really brought up the focus on being mindful and cognizant of ours speaking when we communicate to people,
primarily using a non-violent communication framework. This also means being empathetic to other's feelings and
understanding the needs and requests of others.

Teamwork and Strengths

Focusing on our strengths while working together is important. Through the understanding of our strengths of each team
member, we can better produce quality work and have a great time doing it. This comes up in two ways, with pairing and
with the larger group projects. Lastly we spoke about using these strengths in an AGILE way. Doing team standups,
and working together to help each other solve problems.

Collaborative Communication

This gear up required the pre-reading of a couple of chapters from an updated version of the Dale Carnegie book.
Specifically, how to ask questions instead of giving direct orders, as well as how to handle failure. I thought this
was a productive gear up because we need project management and communication skills to help keep our jobs, as
technical skill is not enough to succeed. Lastly, mitigating fault is very important to help others overcome their
failures so that they can be refocused in order to succeed.

Session 4

Johari Window

I thought this feedback session was quite interesting. Getting the johari survey results back showed pretty good
consistency in response of the perceived character traits that were surveyed. I think I knew what people thought,
but it further reinforces what I think of myself, which is that I need to be a more positive and happy person.
Although none of the survey results indicated a negative aspect, it is clear that people see  me as a driven and
intelligent individual. I actually would like to be seen as brighter, more cheerful, and happy. This is important
to me because I think negativity has brought me down in the past.

Community Participation

I enjoyed the block chain spike sessions that I attended. It certainly is hard to put any effort towards that with
the amount of work that Turing has for us. As for actual participation, I would like to give lightning talks at
wrap up. Maybe it is just in my head, but I don't feel like I have a supportive group around me.
