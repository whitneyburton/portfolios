-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious](https://github.com/ACC25/consume-github)**
>* A web app that consumes the GitHub API and displays basic account information, summary feeds, and repositories. It uses OAuth to authenticate each user.
>* It was great practice working with an API and helped solidify my knowledge of Faraday.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/ACC25/rails_engine)**
>* This project was designed to mimic a sales data API, where you can query merchants, customers, invoices, transactions, items, and their associations.
>* I was weak in SQL and ActiveRecord before this project and this helped me understand how to join multiple tables together in a query.

> **Cloney Island**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/ACC25/trail-up)**
>* Trail Up allows users to browse from thousands of trails across North America and create hiking events, and connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.
>* It was tough keeping up with the pace of my group members, but it was really rewarding to see how much could be accomplished in two weeks with a passionate team.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/squeemishly/dark_clout)**
>* The goal of this project was to inherit an already working codebase and build upon the existing functionality. The original app was a clone of 'Dropbox', so we opted to use your documents, images and Facebook 'public profile' and photos to visualize how much information you are exposing when you authorize with Facebook.
>* It was a great, and terrible, experience working on another groups codebase. I had a lot of fun scanning documents and figuring out what I could do with them. It reminded me how much I like working with language and I think I'm going to start working on a natural language analyzer of some sorts on the side.

## C. **Gear Ups**


### Gear Up 1: Microaggressions

I thought the discussion that we had as a class was really interesting, because it showed how complicated an issue this is and how difficult it is to deal with. When do you speak up? When you do step in? Will it hurt your career? I had never considered dealing with it via sarcasm and I will definitely keep that with me as I move into the industry. It was a good reminder to keep this mind, as I had definitely forgot it was a thing, so it goes to show the conversation is important.

### Gear up 2: Allyship

 I thought the gear up was good, but I had a lot of issues with the second scenario. As a vegan, I have to say no to things more often than not (certainly more than anyone would say no to alcohol) and the idea of changing an entire groups plan for a few people is ridiculous -- especially over something that they can ignore. I can go to a steak house and just order a salad. What other people order doesn't matter. Someone who doesn't want to drink can go to a bar and order water. It comes down to whether you respect the others in your group and can acknowledge that they can have a different opinion than you -- and not be bothered by it. If it's addiction related that is a different story, but the scenario did not mention that. I think this example devalues the entire discussion, which is an important one. This would be the example that makes someone question the overall message, in my opinion.

### Gear up 3: Looking good - body language

I really enjoyed this gear up! Body language control has always been a challenge of mine, so any new information I get is welcome. I think I'm starting to understand how deliberate body language is and how I need to pay attention and not just do what is natural. Watching a speech without sound was a fun exercise in trying to guess the techniques used in conveying a message.  

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**
* I am a co-leader of Golick Posse and paired a few times throughout the mod.

#### **Posse**
  >* My posse has done a lightning talk, but mostly just talks casually about Turing related subjects.  
  >* I don't have anything good to say about the new posses.
  >* The new posse structure hasn't helped me grow professionally.

#### **Playing a Part**

* Nothing to add.
