# \Charlie Corrigan - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

> \During Mod3, my main area of focus was on learning to produce and consume APIs and begin incorporating Javascript and AJAX calls into my projects. I also looked forward to gaining more comfort in diving into other people's code bases and learning effective techniques for approaching browfield projects that utilized tools and techniques that I was unfamiliar with.

>* \This mod has had some of the most interesting content so far at Turing. Using Oauth and APIs has really expanded the possibilities and overall potential of the web apps I'm able to create.
>* \<Notes>

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[APIcurious Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/apicurious)**
> **[APIcurious Repo](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/apicurious)**
>* \Mod3 only included a single individual project, which was not evaluated. For APICurious I used Oauth and the Github API to begin cloning the user dashboard of the Github website.
>* \This project was a nice introduction to consuming APIs, using both Rails and Faraday as well as Javscript/fetch. It was also a good reminder that I need to maintain my Bootstrapping skills so that I'm able to produce functional and attractive front-ends, even when I don't have time to hand roll them in plain CSS.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine Assignment](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/rails_engine)**
> **[Rales Engine Repo](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/rales_engine)**
>* \Use Rails and advanced ActiveRecord and SQL queries to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema

>* \This was one of my favorite projects since Mod1. I had a wonderful partner who was really helpful in pushing me to keep my code very clean and my github workflow on point. I really enjoyed puzzling through the business logic and I hope I get to continue using SQL/ActiveRecord in challenging ways moving forward.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**
> **[Cloney Island Sprint 1](https://github.com/charliecorrigan/cloney-island)**
>* \Use the Google Places and Google Maps APIs to remake Sygic Travel.

>* \My personal areas of focus in this group project were consuming the Google Places API to produce a list of attractions by city and a list of details for each attraction, consuming the Google Maps API to create maps of those cities with dynamic icons of their attractions, creating and styling the attractions and attraction sidebar, and CRUDing the vendor tables. I was also able to pair with group members who needed a little extra help. I got a lot of extra experience helping my teammates to clear up complex merge conflicts and even got to troubleshoot and solve a rather challenging schema issue that was introduced into the project's repo late in the project. I'm definitely stronger and more confident in both Git and Github as a result. This was my first experience trying to incorporate Javascript into a project and while it was challenging to dive into code that I was unfamiliar with, this element on the sprint was exciting and really enjoyable as well.

> **[Cloney Island Sprint 2](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/corkboard)**
>* \Create a clone of the Thumbtack web app, starting with browfield code created by students in the first sprint of Cloney Island in a prior mod.
>* \This was one of my favorite projects so far at Turing. I had a really great group and because we started with a lot of the CRUDing already complete (though in need of a little TLC in places), we were all able to pursue learning and features in areas we were interested in. My main area of focus was in creating an API for the user's projects and then rendering the user dashboard using AJAX calls, allowing a user to update their project's status using a JWS token inside an AJAX call, and allowing a user to leave reviews for pros on projects that are marked as completed.

> Rales Engine evaluation comments:
\None

> Cloney Island Sprint 1 evaluation comments:
\Functional Client Expectations: All the javascript! Nice work. Code Quality: To increase this score, move the javascript into its own file with a referencing script tag. A presenter would also clean up some of the instance variables in the view. Would like to avoid hashes in the view as well

> Cloney Island Sprint 2 evaluation comments:
\None

## C. **Gear Ups**

> [Microaggressions](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/microaggressions_original.markdown)
\We read a couple of articles about microaggressions, spent a few minutes reflecting, and then discussed in small groups strategies for responding to microagressions in effective ways. I appreciated the focus of this GearUp on what we can do to be allies to each other instead of just acknowledging that there's a probem. I thought it was a really useful and positive discussion.

> [Being an Ally](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/allyship.markdown)
\We read a couple of articles about allyship and broke into small groups to discuss. One of the questions we considered in each of the scenarios was: "What are the consequences of doing nothing?" I think that it's a really impactful question to ask.

> [15 THINGS ABOUT THE ATTENTION ECONOMY (YOU WON’T BELIEVE NUMBER 3)](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m4_sessions/1706-inning/group_two.md)
\We watched an informative video introducing the concept of the attention economy, broke into small groups to discuss. I thought the most interesting part of the discussion was in debating whose responsibility it is to regulate (or not) technologies that prey on human pcychology to create addiction responses. For me, this GearUp session was especially useful in reminding me that once I'm creating applications professionally, I ought to also be considering whether or not what I'm building is ethical. I haven't worked in private business professionally before and it's good to remember that some businesses put profit before ethics.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Posse**
  >* \Hamilton Posse used this mod to get to know each other and to share out our week's experiences. We also invited one of our possee mentors to a meeting to hear about his experiences in the job hunt.
  >* \I enjoyed getting to know students from other mods.
  >* \Getting to work with posse mentors on a project and talk with them about their post Turing experience was a valuable experience

#### **Playing a Part**

> \I enjoyed getting to help students from Mod1 and Mod2 on their projects, as well as occasionally helping and being helped by students in my own cohort. As always, I wish there had been more time to work with other students outside of ciriculum requirements.
