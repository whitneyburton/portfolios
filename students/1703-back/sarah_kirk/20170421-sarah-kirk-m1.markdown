# SARAH KIRK - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

6 weeks, 4 flat tires, 5 celebratory beers, and numerous cups of coffee have brought me to the end of Mod 1. In this time, I have surprised myself again and again with how far I have come. However, this has not come without its ups and downs.  

I have learned so much in and out of programming. My mettle was without a doubt tested. I learned the hard lesson of swallowing my pride and asking for help. Since then, I have actively worked toward engaging my peers and Turing staff for help. I have come out the other side a stronger individual.   

Turing has caused me to do a lot of self reflection, not only on my learning style, but as a means to understand my classmates and be the best version of myself. I have found that I do my best work with a team, or in a situation in which I can talk directly to someone to bounce ideas off of.

Looking into future mods it is my goal to improve my individual performance, and make myself available to lower mods for pairing sessions. I felt that I spent Mod 1 getting a feel for my surroundings, and I intend on using the future mods to pursue some of my outlying interests.

### Define-the-Relationship (DTR)

[Link](https://gist.github.com/sarahdactyl71/34ca2a943a128acce1af60156f438624) to DTR Memo from 1 paired project.

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 Tom Soucie:

**Feedback for Tom:**

> I can honestly say that I couldn’t have asked for a better partner. We work extremely well together, and you really jive with my learning style. I think a large part of our success was how thoroughly we defined our relationship so that there were no surprises when I told you about how I get hangry or that I need a lot of communication to make sure things are going well. When asked to reflect on problems that we had run into, I mostly found myself looking at things I could have done better. I appreciated that you pulled me out of some “holes” with coffee and telling me that we needed to take a break. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with you and I hope that we pair again in the future.


**Feedback from Tom:**

> Sarah always came to our project meetings with an upbeat attitude which helped us both get started with great energy. There were times during our project when we would encounter challenges writing the code, and figuring out the right way to solve the problem. Whenever we'd encounter this kind of "resistance" Sarah always maintained a positive attitude. Her willingness to work through the challenge was very motivating, and helped me stay mentally engaged and working on the problem. Sarah's motivating energy and positive outlook helped us complete the project and was a great asset to our team!

#### Project 2 Carl Richmond:

**Feedback for Carl:**

> When dealing with a project like Headcount, Carl made it very easy to talk problems through and implement what we had spoken about to code. His debugging with pry skills still continue to impress me, and I think it is a large factor to finishing the project. He was willing to put in the long hours every day (even when his partner was visiting) to meet the daily goals we had set for ourselves when we DTRed. Sometimes during our project, I would make the same suggestion as how to change our code two or three times before it was acknowledged. This made me feel that my contributions were not valued. Also, there were times when Carl would work on the project without me, and without much communication as to what he was changing. This left me to do a lot of catch up when we sat down together again. Going forward my suggestions for Carl would be to take into consideration the suggestions his partners make before brushing them aside, and to communicate more effectively about what he is doing to the code independently. Overall, Carl was an easy-going partner to work alongside. It was fun to figure out problems, and ride the roller-coaster that is Headcount with him.

**Feedback from Carl:**

> I think that Sarah brought a really good energy to the project and her ability to rap was a hilarious unexpected addition. She was really good in brainstorming sessions and didn't let the stress of not knowing something get in the way of pushing forward, which I think was really critical for getting where we did in Headcount. The project was so difficult that if one person allowed themselves to get a "stress" mental block it would break the flow of the project. I enjoyed that she jumped in and took charge when she noticed I had been driving for too long. Her ability to manipulate enums saved us at a few critical points. I don't have any suggestions for her to improve as I thought she was a great communicator and project partner overall. Headcount was really stressful, so the fact we didn't snap at each other is a good sign I think!

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

The power of "yet" has been somewhat of a mantra for my time here. Every time I feel downtrodden or the self talk gets too negative, I try and modify my statements with a "yet". For example, "I am not understanding the material yet" or "I'm not biking at a consistent 15 miles per hour yet". Although I would be lying if I said that I no longer have doubts, those doubts are in fact fewer. I am trying to apply the concept of a growth mindset not only to Turing but across my life in wellness, self-talk, and my relationships.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

The term "cognitive load" has been added to my lexicon. This gear up made me realize it was okay to call it a day when my brain just wasn't performing at maximum capacity. I liked to think my cognitive function was a plot of concave down exponential decay. This thought process was an effective means of knowing what was productive work time and knowing when to take care of myself and re-group.

#### Session 3: Introvert vs. Extrovert

It was very enlightening to see that most of Mod 1 put themselves on the introverted side of the introvert/extrovert spectrum. Because I identify as mostly extroverted with some introverted tendencies, it was very powerful to have insight on what a large portion of my classmates needed in terms of personal interaction. The back and forth conversation between those that identified as introvert or extrovert was wonderful, because I was given feedback on how many of my peers wanted to be treated. I could take that and apply it directly to my time at Turing.

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

Strengths and storytelling forced me to come to the conclusion that although my background is incredibly diverse, I simply cannot pack it all into one two minute speech. Saying what I did, and where I came from out loud, made me understand that I really needed to focus on the highlights and my current goals. Hearing the way the other students formatted their speeches inspired me to focus on the positive and the future. Only by telling someone else what brought me to this place made me hear how unintentionally negative my trials and tribulations sounded. I think this is an important topic to keep revisiting during Turing.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

Admittedly, this topic was incredibly triggering for me. I was well aware of the sexism and lack of women in tech, but it broke my heart to hear these brilliant women tell their stories. I directly related with so many of these situations from when I was in college; where I was one of few woman in an engineering curriculum. What hurt more, is that I perceived a few of my classmates didn't take the film seriously, or didn't believe that women are disadvantaged in STEM. Upsetting as it was, it was a perfect catalyst to boost my awareness of how other women in the class felt. Hearing their stories, just from their time at Turing, was a call to action. It has encouraged me to build stronger relationships with my female cohort members and smash the patriarchy as I go.   

### Community Participation

I loved meeting and getting to know all the people in my mod, and additionally, upper mods. Lunch roulette was a perfect opportunity to get some one on one time with members of my cohort and people I had never met up until that point. I did my best to answer questions from my classmates. For what I did not know, I paired with Mod 2 students. To socialize out of school time, I made a slack channel called #brew_hop with the intention of uniting all that love craft beer so that we may explore breweries around town together. I was a part of Wozniak Posse from week one, and have attended all their social lunches and spikes that I was able. I frequent imposters as well. Next inning, I want to explore Turing Lab a bit more and try my hand at building something.
