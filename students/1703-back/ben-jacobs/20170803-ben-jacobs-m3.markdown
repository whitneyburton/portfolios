# Benjamin Jacobs- M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

In Module 3 I specifically set out to become job ready. I wanted to come away from this 6 week period with an understanding of how real development work is done on a larger scale, to challenge myself to push past the boundaries of the classwork and take on new technologies, languages and frameworks in my spare time. Additionally, my plan was to dig in on the job search and start to get all my assets and contact in order for that particular challenge. Lastly, I wanted to find ways to contribute to the well being of my cohort.

## Self-Assessment

| D | **Professional Development** | 4 |
| E | **Feedback & Community Participation** | 2 |

Understanding how to both build and consume API has been at the top of my list of priorities since beginning at Turing and this module was filled with excellent learning opportunities to facilitate that. I believe that I am leaving this mod with a more fully developed understanding of modern web development as well as a level efficacy that I had not previously thought I would reach. I am finally feeling confident that what I don know I will be able to learn well and efficiently.

-----------------------

## A: Individual Work & Projects (Optional)

> **[Request Line](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/request-line)**

Request Line is an application which allows a user to request an addition to a Spotify playlist for which they are not a collaborator. It allows the user to serach through their own playlists, select a song based on a dynamic search, request the addition to the playlist owner and for an owner to approve a request thereby making a change on Spotify.

This project was equally rewarding and difficult. Interacting with an external API for the first time allowed for many difficult but valuable lessons to be learned. It also marked my first opportunity to interact with JavaScript in view. It was one of my favorite projects I have worked on and I hope to continue improving it.


## B: Group Work & Projects

> **[Rales Engine](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/rails-engine)**

A sales data api built with Rails 5.1 and Ruby 2.4.1. This engine serves up record, relationship and business intelligence     JSON for the included dataset.

Getting to build an API for the first time was daunting, but ultimately a joyful experience. After a module punctuated by a UX intensive project, starting off module 3 with a distinctly backend project was refreshing. I was also able to really dig into ActiveRecord and SQL on this project which I always find to be an engaging puzzle.

> **[Cloney Island](http://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/cloney_island/cloney_island)**

> **[TrailUp](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/trail-up)**

Trail Up is a social hiking app with allows users to browse from thousands of trails across North America and create hiking events to connect with other outdoor enthusiasts.

This project was excellent experience working under high stress conditions on a restricted time table. It gave my team the opportunity to explore new technologies and push ourselves to learn new things to incorporate features quickly. Overall it was a valuable experience in team dynamics and time management as well.

> **[Cork Board](https://github.com/Benjaminpjacobs/corkboard)**

Cork Board allows users to find professionals to handles a variety of projects from home-improvement to tutoring. It offers a dynamic market place where professionals can bid for jobs and communicate directly with their would-be customers.

This has been perhaps the most valuable project of the module. Coming in to brownfield code was a variety of lessons in patience, humility, empathy and deduction. Following someone elses train of thought to in order to begin to build on top of it was an opportunity I'm glad to have gotten earlier on. In addition it was a great chance to start experimenting with React, MongoDB and SOA.

## C. **Gear Ups**

Gear ups this module were mainly centered around how to be an Ally and to recognize situation in one's community where the opportunity to be one can be exercised. Many of these conversations continue to stick with me even now. Specifically the gear up on micro-aggressions stands out as one that permanently altered the way I saw my own actions and my role in group dynamics. It has been important to me moving forward to not only try to be more thoughtful of my own voice and actions(intents vs impact), but to be more consciously aware of the interactions around me.

## D: Community Participation

#### **Community Contribution Option**

This module I tried to make a habit of pairing more often with students in the module below me. Taking the time to go through code with other members of the community has been enlightening and educating in ways that I did not expect. Besides obvious benefits of solidifying concepts that may be getting stale with disuse, there is the overwelming feeling of community contribution and a sense of camaraderie that kept me looking for those opportunities. Being able to impart even the smallest tid-bit of knowledge I've retained is extremely gratifying.

#### **Playing a Part**

In general I have tried to remain a sensitive and present member of my cohort. Trying to remain available and approachable for situations both technical and non-technical has been my most relevant contribution to the community. Additionally, participation as a speaker in one of the try turing events this module was an attempt to be involved not just in the current iteration of Turing but in its future.
