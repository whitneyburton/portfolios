# FIRST LAST - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

During Module 1, I hoped to gain a firm understanding of the basic concepts of ruby. I envisioned learning the fundamentals of programming, TDD, and Git. Not only do I feel I was able to accomplish a foundational understanding of these concepts, but I was able to grow as a person and team member as well.

###Notes
* Reflecting on all that I have accomplished this module, overall I believe I was successful in all areas and learned a lot.
* The link I provided for Jungle Beat is being updated. (play method now works)

### Pair Feedback

Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Larisa Anderson):

**Feedback for Larisa:**

> During the week of our pairing project I saw how invested you are in learning and even though you say it's not clicking believe me it is, Your brain is doing the job in the background, one of this days you will have that elusive AHAA!! moment that we all love. Also I would like to add that maybe for your next time, take into consideration the type of person your partner is, since you are an extrovert and I'm an introvert I felt pressured to work in your style instead of the way that works the best for me. I do have say that when we divided our tasks, me the key-maker , Larisa the Offset generator, you did a wonderful job reaching out to the right people and fulfilled the job in timely manner, communication is also one of your strengths to be proud of. Lastly, I would like to add that I’m very proud of your performance during our evaluation, it showed how much you've learned.

**Feedback from Larisa:**

> When I found out I was paired with Chantal, I felt a wave of relief sweep over my body. How lucky was I to be paired with such and understanding, smart, and friendly person. We made our DTR, and we both knew that because of my lack of experince it was going to be a tough project to both feel that we we're going to be able to contribute equally. We started out working together, and we decided that we were going to divide and concour. Looking back I feel that this wasn't the best way to start our project. Reason being is I needed to be able to see the ins and outs of the code to help me understand the problem. I started to work on the project with Dave Maurer, and invited Chantal to work with us. We decided that we should stop moving forward until I was able to catch up. I am not sure if this was the best idea for the project, but it made sense at the time. Chantal, I really appreciated your work on the project. You were very commited to finding the answer to the problems. I know that this dedication to coding will take you far. You also have a great gift in pateince, and believe me I know all about patience. Had you been a partner that wasn't able to take a step back and genuinly care that I was apart of the project it would have turned out badly for us both.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

I really enjoyed the Gear Up session on growth mindset. Attending to Turing requires that not only your brain but body and soul are in Growth Mindset state, It doesn't matter how smart you are, if you are in a fixed mindset nothing will grow through and If you add bad attitud you'll get in trouble, I know keeping the GM can be challenging but is a thing that I try to keep track of. I also pay attention to my wins it doesn't matter big or small is a win and it needs to be celebrated. If mind and body are connected everything will workout.
