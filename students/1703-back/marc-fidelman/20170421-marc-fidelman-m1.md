# MARC FIDELMAN - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Ruby. Ruby was my emphasis. I found at the end of last mod I was explaining a number of the computer science concepts to my classmates while I couldn't make a method function. That unstable building block seemed to scuttle all my attempts. I think that I finally got it on Jungle Beats. With quite a bit of thanks to Lauren Fazah and David Maurer for taking the time with me to explain ruby functionality at a granular and behind the scenes level. This mod I have a healthy side of community engagement, but I felt that I finally got to experience the learning value of teaching coding concepts to others.

### Pair Feedback


#### Project 1 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Rhonda Wilhelmson:**

Rhonda, I had a great time working on the Enigma project with you. There are a lot of areas where I felt we were a good balance for each other. I think the way we defined our working relationship and made a point of being up front about weaknesses we were aware of helped us support each other effectively. You really helped keep me from getting us into rabbit holes. I think the strongest suggestion I have is to front load the time put into a project and stick to a real pomodoro schedule. We both have that urge to plow through to a goal but it’s important to recognize that effort spent with a tired brain is often poor quality. I hope you keep up with experimenting in the console and using pry to affirm ruby behavior, it goes a long way to avoiding keyboard paralysis. I’m not going to forget running our first crack anytime soon, I’m glad I got there with you: “not so secret anymore ..end..”

**Feedback from Rhonda Wilhelmson:**

Feedback from Rhonda:
I am grateful that Marc was very conscious and self-aware during the entirety of our project. Every step of the way, Marc made sure to check in with me regarding my feelings and understanding of the project and his role in those feelings. I think our main issue with the project came from developing an effective time table and thorough planning that we could stick to throughout the course of our coding process. I believe that this was overlooked and/or put on the back burner in the beginning by both of us and never revisited. I think we definitely should have at least tried to break down the project into a schedule of what we wanted to accomplish every day and we also shouldn’t have let ourselves get stuck on a minor issue with the coding for such a long period of time that other aspects of the project were overlooked. That isn’t exactly a critique of Marc individually as I think that was a shared responsibility. I enjoyed working with Marc and tackling my first paired project.

#### Project 2 (Partner Name):

**Feedback for Aaron Olsen:**

I am very glad I was paired with Aaron Olsen for Headcount. Aside from being a pleasure to work with, Aaron has a capacity to wrap his head around complex moving parts and explain his vision for them. Connected with a fearlessness in pry and a swiftly growing familiarity with ruby, Aaron really brought a lot to the table. His fixation on the challenge of the task at hand goes a long way, but Aaron would go faster and further if he could orate his process to colleagues or partners sooner. I also think Aaron may find some increases in efficiency by more often considering a dev-environment that shows more than just one program on the screen at once, especially for trouble shooting. While these are areas where I think Aaron can improve, it is worth note that I have already witnessed significant growth in these areas just over the course of the project.

**Feedback from Aaron Olsen:**

Headcount was a massive project and really stretched both of our coding skills. Marc was right there the whole time keeping the momentum going to get through it. Marc's workflow and knowledge of shortcuts and tricks was a huge help for me. I gained a lot from watching how he organized his workflow and how he used his editor to code. This project required a lot of problem solving and thinking ahead, and Marc was a great asset in discussing and figuring out some of more difficult aspects of the problems. The only real bump we ran into was when Marc overlooked an aspect of the spec. This required us to go back and rewrite a section of the project which put us a little behind. In the future I would make sure to double check the spec to make sure it is being followed correctly. I learned a lot from this project and Marc was a big part of that learning. Headcount was big and complex, and having Marc as a partner made the learning experience valuable and worthwhile.

### Job Prep

*  [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcfidelman/)
  I am a trained technician with a background in sustainability and customer service currently studying object oriented programming with Turing’s back end development program. I have a for-profit oriented passion for environmental and social responsibility that fuels an admiration of efficiency.  Software development is just the latest tool I am excited to get to better learn in the field.

## E: Community

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

Growth mindest is so important. It wasn't until I was at Turing that I had a term for it, but I remember as early as kindergarten being lucky enough to have teachers that would harp on the word "YET". You can't... yet. You don't... yet. You aren't... yet. There are things that I consider limitations, but they are all in the form of compromise: to do that, I would also have to do this or maybe never do this. It's all a matter of how strong your passion is and what you're willing to do to reach a goal.

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

I still like the mastering of tasks in 45 minute bursts. I still have trouble with letting things "pile up on B". I didn't relate to the Ta-Nehisi Coates portion at all. I feel like embarking on something like learning a language should be very evidently a vast task. Just as much as coding, or sculpture, or any of the sciences. But with language in particular, any phase of "oh, this must be simple" to me reeks of ignorance at best and hubris or even racism at worst.

#### Session 3: Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert

I think I was pretty familiar with the Introvert Extrovert spectrum before this gear up. I think I wasn't prepared for how much I come off as an extrovert at Turing. I really do have strong introvert behaviors and needs. They are masked by the fact that I feel so passionately about intentional community. Even with people familiar with the behavioral spectrum I found myself explaining a little about the idea that if you feel strongly about something, you can exhibit different behavior.

#### Session 4: Storytelling & Strengths (StrengthsFinder I)

My strengths finder story has a lot to do with getting comfortable with my aspects of being an information hoarder and demanding data driven action. The Analytical characteristic is the strength that I always knew a little about how it challenged me with other people but it wasn't until going through the strengths finder and really discussing it with Lauren and other people that I had a vocabulary for it. The information gathering is still readily seen as a positive trait. I'm a resource. The analytical one is the one that I think some people take longer to appreciate, it's only as people get to know me that the find times to be grateful for my pushing for analysis before action. I still need to find a better way to pitch this side of me.

#### Session 5: Code: Debugging the Gender Gap

I have such strong feelings about this one. I clearly wasn't the only one. I was heartened that our discussion went over time for the gear up. We continued into our SAB time slot without instructors as well, wherein we had a few people crying, but crying amidst support. I'm a pretty relaxed person, I try really hard to keep in mind that people are human and they all have hopes and dreams and fears and passions. All forms of bigotry dehumanizes its victims. For a long time my main concern has been environmental issues, it's tough for some people to understand that environmental issues are humanitarian issues at their base. In that light the damage inflicted by the patriarchy enrages me deeply. I think climate change does have the power to be a mass extinction level event. It's a complex global issue that requires globalized cooperation. It might not be every day, but I often wonder how we can tackle that level of cooperation when we can't seem to stop killing each other over who's religion is more correct much less casually deciding who is predestined for success or not based on their looks and gender and accent or any number of other arbitrary anti-meritocrical assessments. Clearly frustration leads to run on sentences. There are a few conversations that were started from this gear up that I still need to follow up on.

### Community Participation

I think my community engagement was fairly deep this mod. I feel like I spent a fair amount of time getting to know Turing as an organization last mod, and to me understanding how it works is crucial to my success. I don't think I'm the only one who operates that way, and I felt the need to share my experience. Taking on the SAB role was a way to signify to my classmates that I'm comfortable talking about my last mod in detail. It was a good position for me to be able to say "yes there's precedent for this" or "no that's unusual, maybe you should talk with this person about it". I also like this role... It has been a long time since I was engaged in this way with a community and I forgot how much I lean into those kinds of challenges. I really do think that wonderful things can come from intentional community. In that respect I'm excited by what Turing has to offer, but more than that I feel I see a lot of potential. 1703-BE is such a great group, I have full confidence that continuing to work with them will be a pleasure and they'll prove to be a force for positive change around here.
