# TOM SOUCIE - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The first module of Turing has been one of the most challenging experiences of my life. There's definitely been times I've felt like I was thrown into the deep end of the pool, but after 6 weeks I'm starting to adjust and appreciate the intensity. I'm starting to figure out how to best utilize all the collaboration at Turing through pairing, posse work and informal coaching/demo with other students and instructors. While I have been immensely challenged, the concept of "growth mindset" has lit a fire for me to keep moving forward and continuing to work to improve and learn.

I started Mod1 with the desire to better understand all the basic Ruby concepts and TDD. I have gotten confident with these concepts and learned so much more including git workflow, SimpleCov testing tools, and ORM. I've also really started to enjoy pairing and project work, which petrified me 6 weeks ago. Getting to collaborate and contribute to a project has been a very positive experience and I'm excited to continue this collaborative work in future mods and as a software developer.

### Pair Feedback

*Feedback from partner projects.

#### Project 1 (Enigma):

**Feedback for Sarah Kirk:**

> Sarah was a great partner for me as she would ask questions and check in and make sure we were both on the same page. Sarah also had a few merge conflicts but I think again this was due to lack of experience and just part of the learning process with git.  I felt the biggest issues faced during our project were merge conflicts with git and the overall "problem" of the Enigma machine and how it was to be completed for the project. The merge conflicts were a result of inexperience with git and improved over the course of the project. The technical aspects of the problem were dramatic at first but Sarah and I worked together to get the issues resolved, but I felt the complexity resulted in me not verbally communicating at times and simply staring at the monitor and reading to understand the project and code.  Sarah was a great partner for me as she would ask questions and check in and make sure we were both on the same page. Sarah also had a few merge conflicts but I think again this was due to lack of experience and just part of the learning process with git.

>Sarah always came to our project meetings with an upbeat attitude which helped us both get started with great energy. There were times during our project when we would encounter challenges writing the code, and figuring out the right way to solve the problem. Whenever we'd encounter this kind of "resistance" Sarah always maintained a positive attitude. Her willingness to work through the challenge was very motivating, and helped me stay mentally engaged and working on the problem. Sarah's motivating energy and positive outlook helped us complete the project and was a great asset to our team!

**Feedback from Sarah Kirk:**

> I can honestly say that I couldn't have asked for a better partner. We work extremely well together, and you really jive with my learning style. I think a large part of our success was how thoroughly we defined our relationship so that there were no surprises when I told you about how I get hangry or that I need a lot of communication to make sure things are going well. When asked to reflect on problems that we had run into, I mostly found myself looking at things I could have done better. I appreciated that you pulled me out of some "holes" with coffee and telling me that we needed to take a break. Overall, it was a pleasure to work with you and I hope that we pair again in the future.

#### Project 2 (Headcount):

**Feedback for Mason Holland:**

> This has been the most difficult and lengthy project of the most difficult educational venture I've ever attempted but it was great to work with Mason on this project. At times I was overwhelmed with the scope of what has fondly become known as "Bodycount", but Mason's positive attitudue kept us moving forward. Mason always came to work with a great outlook even when we were facing stress and uncertainty with the project, and his positive attitude helped me stayed engaged with the work. Mason was always obliging when I need a break, and we worked well together in pairing. I need to work at "navigating" more explicitly and Mason is great at giving friendly feedback during pairing, keeping the work fun even when the project requirements were challenging. 

>Mason's strength of understanding of Ruby syntax and hash methods complimented my affinity for testing, allowing us to make significant progress toward completion of all the project specifications. As Mason continues to work to improve his programming skills he could improve the frequency of commits, but I'm extremely happy with what we've learned on this project and was grateful Mason was my partner for this challenge.

**Feedback from Mason Holland:**

> I found Tom to be a wonderful pairing partner. We worked well together and I found his ability to be open and communicative contributed to the projects success. He was accommodating and hard working. We were able to share ideas and help develop our project as a team. His willingness to ensure we each "drove" and "navigated" in equal parts ensured that we each had a strong working knowledge of the code. I had fun the whole time on top of that so I would gladly pair with Tom in the future.

### Gear Up

#### Session 1: Growth Mindset

This was a great gear up for me as I've only recently heard about the concept of "growth mindset" and I had definitely been raised with the concept of a "fixed" mindset, that each individual is limited to certain skills and abilities and there's a limit to how much that can be expanded. Growth mindset is the opposite of this, with the mindset that any person can learn a new skill if they only work at it. This is a super powerful concept, but I still sometimes struggle with a fixed mindset when facing a challenging new topic or a project I can can't get to work. When this happens I take a second to remember growth mindset and get back into the state of mind of learning and growing. The supportive learning environment at Turing helps make it OK to not know everything, and to ask questions to keep growing and learning. Learning from peers also helps me ask the right question and break the question/problem down into more manageable size, making it easier to understand and work through. Which helps keep a growth mindset!

#### Session 2: Getting Better at Difficult Things

This gear introduced a neat topic around perceptual learning and how to build up difficult skills faster. The example of of determining chicken gender was pretty interesting and demonstrated how such a vague skill could be picked up most efficiently through perceptual learning. I want to start using this mindset in pairing, and for following demos/tutorials online. I really appreciated the different phases of learning and how to best accumulate the highest level of skill, which will help me as a progress as a software developer. 

#### Session 3: Dealing with Difference: Introvert vs. Extrovert

Being more of an introvert, it was  great to hear this topic and how I can utilize this as a strength. As an introvert I try to be more self aware and "check in" when working with others that are more extroverted, so I can ensure I'm being a good partner and supporting the project. This topic also had me thinking a lot about growth mindset, and how I can push myself beyond social comfort zones to become a better presenter/instructor in the future. It was enjoyable to learn more about my classmates in the group discussions and learn how varied our personalities are when it comes to introversion vs. extroversion.   

#### Session 4: Strengths & Storytelling

I think my perception and understanding of my strengths has enhanced over the last few weeks, and I'm continuing to work to use my strengths to enhance my learning and the learning of my cohort (Maximizer). Through the strength "learner" I feel like I'm continually engaged and motivated by new topics, and connectedness helps me reach out to my classmates when I need help or can offer some support. I have had to deal with a lot of personal discouragement and frustration in learning some of the more advanced Ruby topics over the last few weeks. Even though I have the strength of being "analytical" it doesn't mean that picking up the new language and syntax comes easy to me, and I've been getting discouraged and questioning "Why am I even doing this?". I know this is my lack of growth mindset, and I need to stay engaged with the struggle, and I try to use an analytical mindset to work through the discouragement. I try to make sure I recognize only a few months ago I hadn't even been aware of many of these concepts that I've mastered and feel confident in executing. While I have a lot of work left, I keep trying to use my strengths to build a growth mindset, stay mentally engaged with the "struggle", and keep working on ways to improve my learning process and help the learning of my cohort.

Through acknowledging and working through the "struggle" I think it can help to normalize how difficult some of these concepts and topics can be. And I hope by sharing this to help others not feel bad or "less than" when they also struggle when learning new concepts. The struggle in seeking to break into the software industry is something I want to help others with in the future, and is definitely something that will continue to be a part of my story.

#### Session 5: Debugging the Gender Gap

This short film reinforced my decision to attend to Turing, just for the focus on the mission and bringing issues highlighted by 'Code' to part of the education conversation. This film definitely brings about an emotional response for me, as while I cannot imagine being in the place of a female in a hostile male work environment, I know how frustrating trying to learn Ruby in a super supportive environment like Turing, so I can only think the frustration and emotional pain of some of the females in the film was infinitely worse. It only furthers my passion for learning web development and helping others learn web development to increase the number and diversity of qualified developers. 

### Community Participation

During the first few weeks at Turing I tried out several different posses for spike times and after class meetings (Wozniak, Supercool Study Groups & Productivity Lunch) and eventually settled on the Armstrong posse for the last 2 weeks. It was great to interact with students from other Mods and see how in a short time they've developed the skills and abilities to learn new languages and pick up the ability to create and make. Which is super motivating that at the end of Turing I'll be able to do that too! I've also taken opportunity for pairing twice a week, and started taking advantage of impostors meetings and informal lunches / walk breaks with other students. The community at Turing has become my favorite part of the school environment. After the "learning difficult things" gear up I really bought into pairing (I was definitely resistant at first simply due to fear of making mistakes in front of others) and I've realized what a powerful and useful learning and production tool pairing is. Even though this is just one small example of the benefit I've gained from the Turing community, I want to give back more to future mods. Some possible things I want to support are helping with Armstrong posse and the Turing podcast. Podcasts are my favorite medium of entertainment / education so it would be great to help promote Turing in this form!
