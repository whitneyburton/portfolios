# Marla Brizel - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My goals for this module were simple and twofold: learn JavaScript, and find a job. Mission accomplished on both fronts: JavaScript is no longer the crazy foreign beast that it was to me at the end of Module 3 (though I still have much to learn) and I'm excited to start work after school (after a long nap).

### Attendance

I missed a day on November 6 due to illness. I dodged in and out on various other occasions for interview-related activities.

### Final Assessment

1. Satisfactory Progress
**3:** Developer completes iterations 1 through 6 with few bugs or missing functionality

2. Ruby Syntax & Style
**3:** Developer is able to write idiomatic and effective Ruby. Application makes good use of Object-Oriented modeling with few gaps in class identification and component extraction.

3. Rails Style & API
**3:** Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data.

4. Javascript Syntax & Style
**3:** Developer writes solid Javascript code using common patterns and idioms. Code is organized appropriately within objects and functions.

5. Testing
**4:** Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification

6. User Interface
**3:** The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality

7. Delivery Deadlines
**3:** The project was completed by 9pm of the day it was assigned.

### Work

This module was comprised largely of solo-projects.

#### IdeaBox 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/ideabox-js)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

IdeaBox 2.0 was a reimplementation of the Rails IdeaBox, but this time with JavaScript. While the project still used Rails as a backend, the frontend was implemented with vanilla JS, AJAX, and jQuery. My goals for this project were to get a more solid footing in JS in general and to understand better how to make a Rails backend and a JS frontend play nice with each other.

* **Features: 4**
* **User Interface: 4**
* **Rails Style: 4**
* **Ruby Style: 4**
* **JavaScript Style: 3**

The project was evaluated by Dave Shim with the following comments:
`Solid project.  Completed all requirements and one extension.  Follows MVC model.`

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

The Scale Up took a legacy codebase from previous Turing students and injected over a million rows onto the database. We were then charged with bringing the application back to life without detracting from overall UX. There were also some bugs and other surprises that needed attention along the way.

**Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring: 4**
* **Load Testing / User Scripting: 3**
* **Database Load: 3**
* **Performance Optimization Techniques: 4**
* **Additional Features: 4**

**Notes:** Great use of puma on production. Got as much out of the free Heroku instance as you could.

This was my favorite project. I got to dig into the fun DevOps problems that caught my eye at the end of Module 3. I used Sidekiq, Redis, Airbrake, Librato, as well as the techniques covered in class. I had a lot of fun geeking out over dyno optimization.

#### Real Time

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/poll-me)

Oof. This was by far the worst thing I produced during my time at Turing. My job hunt exploded (in a good way!) during the week we had this assignment and I had very little time to devote to the project. As it became clear relatively early on that my project would not resemble the original assignment, I reached out to Steve so that we could reset expectations and set some goals I could still feel good about.

Fortunately I've played with Redis probably more than most of the people in my cohort, so I wasn't too concerned about not getting another go at that. I chose to focus on digging into React and while I still don't think I learned as much as I would have liked, I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of things. I do think I have a much better understanding of how Node.js and Express work than I did before the project.

I think Module 1 Marla would have freaked out over not getting good scores on this one, Module 4 me is just happy that I was able to dig into React a little bit. The final product for this assignment was obviously not up to my standards, but I am hopeful that essentially the one outlier of my entire time at Turing won't impact my graduation or standing as an alumna.


## Team

### Projects

This module, we had one team project.

#### Gametime
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/applegrain/bubble-spinner)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this two-week project, we built a shooting game in the browser using JavaScript, Node.js and HTML5 Canvas  

* **Functional Expectations: 3**
* **Test-Driven Development: 3**
* **Breaking Logic into Components: 3**
* **Fundamental JavaScript and Style: 3**

This was one of the more complicated/difficult games we could have chosen and Steve commented on our success in making it work, especially in light of the fact that we were both knee-deep into the job hunt process during the project. I was happy with the time I got to spend particularly on the algorithm side of things and feel like the project had a lot of hard-earned commits


## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided honest feedback to all who asked for it.

### Being a Community Member

* Lots of feedback to come during graduation, I'm sure...
* It was hard to stay as involved during Module 4 simply due to everything going on. After job-hunt and class-related activities, I found myself wanting to spend my leftover free time sleeping.

### Playing a Part

* I gave a talk about Ruby Tooling at the October Denver.rb meetup
* I attended the November Denver.rb meetup
* I attended the 2015 APEX Awards dinner with other staff and students
* I organized meals for 1505's graduation weekend and provided Joanne with a grocery list
* I continued to help students in lower cohorts by pairing with them on projects. I reached out to each member of my posse individually and offered to help mentor.

## Review

### Notes

Solid projects with the exception of Real Time. That said, Marla prioritized the job search and communicated these priorities with the instructional staff, which agreed with her plan.

### Outcome

PROMOTED - your portfolio demonstrates a successful fulfillment of expectations and you may move on to the next module or graduate
