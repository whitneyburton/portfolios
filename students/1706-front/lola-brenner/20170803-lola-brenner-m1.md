#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Build a game where a user guesses a number between 1-100.
Number Guesser is a solo project that served as an introduction to javascript.

needs a pass to clean up HTML, avoid unnecessary nesting
Be mindful of small details of comp
alphabetize CSS properties within CSS rules
work on locking in understanding and implementation of CSS positioning
work to lock in HTML and CSS best practices and understanding
good refactoring instincts in JS, keep it up!
it was clear that the most care and craft was focused on the JS, make sure that HTML and CSS don't fall by the wayside -- they're important, too
good work!

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/linked-list)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In it’s simplest form, the application should have the following:
Two input fields
One for the title of the bookmark
One for the URL that the bookmark should link to
One button for creating the bookmark and adding it to the page
A section for all of the created bookmarks; each bookmark should display:
The title of the bookmark
The URL of the bookmark (this should be clickable and link to the URL)
A button to “Mark as Read”
A button to “Remove” the bookmark
Linked list served as an introduction to DOM manipulation and paired projects.

feeling a sticky on using Github
need to work on comfort with GH, but making good progress with it!
nice solution for the read counters! NEAT!
Really nicely done, great teamwork
good job tackling some refactoring!
very clean HTML and CSS
GOOD JOB!

Feedback:
Lola, you were simply fantastic to work with. From the beginning you guided us through a thoughtful planning planning process. I learned a great deal from you in terms of being strategic. This is best exemplified by the mock-ups and pseudo-code we created at your suggestion. I'm starting this next project in the same exact way because I thought it was so effective. I appreciated how flexible you were with scheduling time to work, especially accounting for me needing to go home and take care of little Gizmo before working in the evenings. I felt that overall we split up work fairly and communicated very well about our tasks, plan, and goals. Given this, I'm having a hard time coming up with concrete coaching suggestions. The one thing I have reflected that I think we both could have done better was guiding one another through the respective code portions we wrote during the bulk of the code writing process. We did this more on the ending side of things, but I know I would have found it helpful to talk with you through the JS more after you mocked it up initially. I know I could have done the same when I was digging into the CSS last weekend. In summary, you were an awesome teammate, I enjoyed working with you, and I hope we get put together on another project soon.

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lolakoala/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Basic functionality included input information into a form and transferring that to the DOM.
We were also expected to be able to manipulate the html proppended to the DOM.
Idea Box served as an introduction to local storage and working with arrays and objects.

lola showed off all the things being stored in the console, and had a very well planned presentation of the project
erik did css
lola did js
css and html super clean and well executed! one single redundant line of css, and one instance of a ‘0px’ that could have been a ‘0’

## D: Professional Skills
I could not find links to the content for every Gear Up. 

### Gear Up
#### Strengths Finder

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_session.md)

I can use the strengths already occuring in my personality to help me as a developer, develop them further, and use them intentionally. I have definitely been more mindful of when and how I access my strengths, and even how they can become blinders for me. I have been working on developing the ones I use less often and being more intentional about accessing them.

#### Growth Mindset

* [GitHub URL]()

This session was really powerful for me. I gre up in a culture of fixed mindset, and fixed mindset guided my choice of schools, areas of study, and careers until I started Turing. I am now less afraid to tackle things I don't feel "good" at knowing that I can develop skills over time with practice.

#### Working Styles

* [GitHub URL]()

This session was extremely valuable because I feel like recognizing and accommocating different working styles is important for pairing. I certainly have a very distinct working style that was difficult to own and be honest about in my first pairing because I felt like it actually hindered our pairing, but I came to realize that it was actually a great asset in the end. This session also brought to light that not only do introverts have very specific needs when it comes to working in a group, but extroverts do as well.

#### Storytelling

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_and_storytelling.md)

In this session, I learned that I can use my strengths to tell my story of becoming/being a developer and also promote myself. Basically that I can use my strengths to create an elevator talk. I am currently working on putting my strengths and career progression together in a more cohesive way, and then pairing that down so that I can summarize myself and my goals in a few sentences.

#### Debugging the Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL]()

This session was eye-opening in many ways, but it also just confirmed my own experience and expectations of the world. My take-away was that there needs to be an industry- and community-wide effort to make space for and encourage women and other minorities to be in the tech industry. I have always been a vocal advocate of people with less priveledge, and even moreso going forward. 

#### Developer Identity

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/developer_identity.md)

This session was about beefing up your online presence and controlling the image you present professionally. I have since created LinkedIn, Twitter, and Stack Overflow profiles. I intend to update them regularly, and over break my plan is to do more connecting and networking via these profiles.

#### Mod 4 Gear Up- Looking Good

* [GitHub URL]()

This session was about body language. We learned how our body language, which we might not even be aware of, can communicate things we didn't necessarily intend. We also learned how to use body language to our advantage. For instance, you can be very intentional with power poses or gestures to convey confidence in interviews or public speaking.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I was quick to offer help when fellow cohort members seemed lost or behind.
I met with Ellen-Mary to incorporate the concept of gender as a spectrum into Gear Ups.
I shared my lightning talk (Role of the Internet in Advancement of LGBT Rights) with my Posse.
I have already made plans to give my lightning talk after a wrap-up next mod.
I have plans to lead a spike about being approachable and inclusive of all genders next mod.
