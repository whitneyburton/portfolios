# Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. You need at least
a three in each category to earn promotion/graduation.

## End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 4: Student achieved two or more "4s" on the assessment
* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment
* 2: Student earned one score below "3" on the assessment
* 1: Student earned two or more scores below "3" on the assessment

## Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 4: Student demonstrates excellent growth by not only achieving satisfactory
evaluations for each project but also pushing their learning beyond expectations.
* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.
* 1: Student does not show the commitment expected of Turing students.

## Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 4: Student consistently helps their teammates be their best selves, learn at
an accelerated pace, and achieve great results.
* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.
* 2: Student participates somewhat in their group work but is either not a
dependable member of the team or achieves consistently sub-par work.
* 1: Student is not a valuable member of their teams.

## Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 4: Student has a significant impact on the learning and spirit of the
people around them.
* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.
* 2: Student participates in most required community activities (demos, lightning talks, etc)
but does not do anything else of significance.
* 1: Student stays in their lane and focuses just on their own learning.

## Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the learning of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own learning by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 4:
* 3:
* 2:
* 1:
